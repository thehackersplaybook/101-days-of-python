This was a year of pushing our products forward while adding helpful new features and working to keep people safe across our platforms.\n\nThese highlights provide a quick overview of some of the year\u2019s biggest accomplishments as we gear up for 2025.\n\n## Looking Forward With Open Source AI, Orion and More\n\n[![A drawing of glasses facing charts and graphs](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Orion.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Orion.png) In 2024, we introduced [Meta AI](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-ai-assistant-built-with-llama-3/), an AI assistant that we believe to be the most advanced one available for free.\n\n[![A drawing of a human-like Llama wearing glasses and a blue scarf](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Llama.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Llama.png)\n\nBuilt using Llama, our open source AI model, Meta AI can be used across Meta\u2019s apps to help you get things done, learn, create and connect with the things and people that matter to you. It can help you plan a trip, study and more, and it\u2019s on track to be the world\u2019s most used AI assistant by the end of the year, with nearly 600 million monthly active users.\n\nEarlier this year, our Founder & CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, [wrote an open letter](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/) about open source AI\u2019s potential to effect meaningful change. With more than 650 million downloads, Llama has become a popular choice in the open source community. [![A drawing of a planet that looks like Saturn](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Threads-Fediverse.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Threads-Fediverse.png) We\u2019ve seen [companies employing Llama](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/how-companies-are-using-meta-llama/) to build technology for the public good, from [localizing educational material](https://ai.meta.com/blog/foondamate-study-aid-education-llama/) to [increasing access to medical information](https://ai.meta.com/blog/bimedix-built-with-llama/) in low-resource communities.\n\nIn addition to AI, we made industry-leading advancements in AR when we introduced [Orion](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/), our first true AR glasses prototype, a key part of our vision to build the next computing platform that puts people at the center so they can be more present, connected and empowered in the world. [![A drawing of a planet highlighting different server locations on different continents](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Expansion.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Expansion.png) We also released [Meta Quest 3S](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/meta-quest-3s-our-most-affordable-mixed-reality-headset/), our most affordable mixed reality headset yet, and brought to market new styles and smart features for [Ray-Ban Meta glasses](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/ray-ban-meta-glasses-new-ai-features-and-partner-integrations/), like helping you remember where you parked and answering questions based on what you\u2019re looking at.\n\nAnd we made significant progress integrating Threads into the [fediverse](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/what-is-the-fediverse/), a global social network of interoperable servers.\n\n## Adding the Features You Asked For\n\n[![A drawing of a storefront](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_WA-Conversations.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_WA-Conversations.png)\n\nWe\u2019re always looking to enhance your experience across our family of apps by adding features that continually raise the bar, and this year was no different.\u00a0[![A drawing of a woman surrounded by objects/symbols of different technological functions, including a coffee cup and a light bulb](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Assistant.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Assistant.png)\n\nFor WhatsApp, we [improved call quality](https://www.instagram.com/metanewsroom/p/DDfDAW-RkNA/) and made in-group calling more flexible, plus we introduced [enhanced AI features](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/new-ai-tools-meta-verified-and-more-for-businesses-on-whatsapp/) for business chats and a new way to [schedule events](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/events-in-whatsapp-communities/). Over on Threads, we added exciting new [web features](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/08/new-threads-features-for-creators-and-businesses/) to help businesses and creators get the most out of the platform \u2013 insights, post scheduling and multiple drafts.\n\n[![A drawing of a light bulb](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_Threads-Insights.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_Threads-Insights.png)We also focused on making sure your experience on Instagram reflects you \u2013 who you are, what you want to see and what you create.\n\n[![An illustration of the Facebook logo surrounded by symbols of interactivity, including a painter's palette and a bicycle](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_FBIRL.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_FBIRL.png) In addition to features allowing you to [edit DMs and pin chats](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/03/instagram-dm-updates/), we introduced new [ways to connect](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/new-ways-to-connect-through-dms/) through Instagram DMs, including nicknames and location sharing, making Instagram an even more vibrant place to connect.\n\n[![An illustration of photographs symbolizing Instagram surrounded by several symbols of different functions a user might add to their algorithm, for instance a musical note](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Stickers.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Stickers.png)\n\nWe know people want to be able to shape their experience on Instagram as their interests and passions change, which is why we started testing a new way to [reset the recommendations](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/introducing-recommendations-reset-instagram/) you see on Instagram\u2019s Explore, Reels and Feed. And for creators, Instagram\u2019s new [trial reels](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/12/trial-reels-try-content-non-followers-first-see-what-perfoms-best/) let creators show your reels to non-followers first to test how they perform.\n\n## Keeping Our Platforms Safe\n\n[![A drawing of a teen surrounded by symbols of interactivity, communication and safety, for instance a lock and Meta's chat-bubble symbol for messaging](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Teen-Accounts-1.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Teen-Accounts-1.png)\n\nIn 2024, we stayed vigilant about security and safety, adapting our platforms for an evolving digital landscape.\n\nWe introduced Instagram [Teen Accounts](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/), giving teens built-in protections which limit who can contact them and the content they see. [![An illustration of a paintbrush painting white over a number of different scenes, such as a living room](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Reccomendation-Reset.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Reccomendation-Reset.png) We [launched a new education campaign](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/instagram-campaign-protect-teens-sextortion-scams) to help teens and parents spot sextortion scams and we [collaborated with](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/preventing-suicide-and-self-harm-content-spreading-online/) experts and peers to help prevent the spread of suicide and self-harm content online.\n\nTo help stop celeb-bait ads and speed up account recovery, we began [testing facial recognition technology](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/testing-combat-scams-restore-compromised-accounts/). [![A smartphone showing different functions as physical buttons, like a video camera and the chat/Messenger icon](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Messenger-E2EE-1-e1735066121158.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Messenger-E2EE-1-e1735066121158.png) This innovative, easy verification method ensures the right person accesses the right account. And we\u2019re protecting communications between you and the people important to you.

The announcements included VR headsets, AR glasses and AI capabilities, all aimed at advancing how users interact with technology.\n\n## Orion: Prototype AR Glasses\n\n![APTOPIX Meta Connect Conference](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66f5c9bf113d5c525667b49b/APTOPIX-Meta-Connect-Conference/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\n\nMark Zuckerberg wears a pair of Orion AR glasses during the Meta Connect conference Wednesday, Sept. ... \\[+\\] 25, 2024, in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez)\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\n\nPerhaps the most exciting announcement was for a product with a release date that remains a mystery. In a noteworthy reveal, Zuckerberg presented a prototype of Meta's first augmented reality glasses, codenamed Orion. These AR glasses represent significant research and development efforts, with echoes of Google\u2019s scrapped Glass project from 2015.\n\nOrion works by overlaying virtual information over a user\u2019s view by using light diffraction to create holographic projections in their field of view. Zuckerberg stated that the display is different from anything else consumers have used, in the sense that it\u2019s not actually a screen. Instead, it\u2019s a different type of display technology that uses small projectors in the arms of the glasses, which emit light into nanoscale 3D structures etched into the lenses.\n\nWhile Meta has not announced a release date for Orion, the prototype demonstrates the company's ongoing investment in AR technology, with unique technology that has the potential to make it stand out from similar offerings from the likes of the Immersed Visor, and even Apple\u2019s much bulkier Vision Pro headset. These glasses could potentially change how users interact with digital information in everyday scenarios, from navigation to real-time translation and entertainment, and with a large play like Meta joining the fray, there could be an increased chance for higher rates of adoption for such technology further down the line.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\n\n[**Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23) [By\\\\\nKevin Payne\\\\\n\\\\\nContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/)\n\n[**Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23) [By\\\\\nCassidy Horton\\\\\n\\\\\nContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton)\n\n## Quest 3S: A More Affordable Mixed Reality Option\n\n![US-INTERNET-TECHNOLOGY-META](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66f5c8c20a72d10459bfe71c/US-INTERNET-TECHNOLOGY-META/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\n\nA Meta employee sets up a Quest 3S, a new entry-level model of Meta's mixed reality headset, for ... \\[+\\] demonstrations for content creators and journalists ahead of Meta Connect, Meta's annual event on its latest software and hardware innovations, in Menlo Park, California, on September 24, 2024.

Enjoy the Daily!\n\n[More Newsletters](https://account.forbes.com)\n\nAnother key announcement was the Meta Quest 3S, a more affordable version of last year's Quest 3 headset. Priced at $299, the Quest 3S aims to make mixed reality experiences accessible to a broader audience, and its RRP is a stark contrast to the $3,499 asking price of Apple's Vision Pro.\n\nWhile it may not include all the features of its higher-priced Quest 3 or Apple counterpart, the Quest 3S retains the core mixed reality capabilities of the Quest 3, allowing users to integrate virtual elements with their physical surroundings. The headset also features spatial audio by Dolby Atmos and can function as a remote desktop for Windows 11 PCs, leveraging Meta's partnership with Microsoft.\n\n## AI Developments\n\nMeta also used Connect as an opportunity to share its AI advancements, introducing various new features across its platforms. A significant announcement was Llama 3.2, Meta's latest AI model capable of processing both images and text \u2014 a first for the company's open-source offerings.\n\nThis multimodal approach expands possibilities for developers, potentially enabling more advanced AI applications. Examples include augmented reality apps with real-time video understanding, visual search engines and document analysis tools. In addition, Meta introduced voice capabilities for its AI assistant, including celebrity voice options such as John Cena, Dame Judi Dench and Kristen Bell.\n\nOther AI-powered features include real-time language translation through Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and automatic video dubbing for content on Instagram and Facebook. These tools could be particularly useful for content creators and marketers aiming to reach global audiences \u2014 although the [EU AI Act](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/09/19/how-the-eu-ai-act-stands-to-impact-business/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20member%20states,t%20be%20the%20first%20time. \"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/09/19/how-the-eu-ai-act-stands-to-impact-business/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20member%20states,t%20be%20the%20first%20time.\") means that these AI features won\u2019t be available to European users for the time being.\n\n## Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: New Features\n\n![Meta Connect Conference](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66f5c9e1a871f72d321714d0/Meta-Connect-Conference/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\n\nMark Zuckerberg speaks about the live translation feature on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses during ... \\[+\\] the Meta Connect conference Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez)\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\n\nMeta announced updates to its smart glasses line-up, developed in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The latest version includes improved AI integration, designed to facilitate more natural interactions with Meta's virtual assistant and enhance object recognition capabilities.\n\nNew features include video AI, real-time translation and expanded content partnerships with services like Spotify, Amazon Music and Audible. These additions clearly aim to strengthen the position of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in the wearable tech market.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nOverall, Meta's continued investment in mixed reality and AI technologies indicates the company's view of these areas as foundational to future computing platforms. By introducing more affordable hardware like the Quest 3S and developing prototypes like Orion, Meta is working toward a future where digital and physical realities are increasingly integrated.\n\nChallenges remain, including user adoption rates, privacy concerns and regulatory considerations. However, Meta's announcements at Connect 2024 demonstrate its commitment to shaping human-computer interaction, which is an area that founder Mark Zuckerberg is clearly betting big on.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/esatdedezade)\u00a0or\u00a0[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esat-dedezade-a9a71243/).\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0[website](https://esatd.net).\n\n[![Esat Dedezade](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/66d774987129931f84cb015d/400x0.jpg?cropX1=0&cropX2=320&cropY1=0&cropY2=320)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/ \"Photo of Esat Dedezade\")\n\n[Esat Dedezade](https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/\")\n\n[Following](https://account.forbes.com/following \"https://account.forbes.com/following\") Follow\n\nEsat Dedezade is a freelance tech and lifestyle journalist with 14 years' experience.

        "markdown": "#### Blog\n\n## Meta IT\u2019s new 2024 tech trends report\n\n### Meta IT presents technological trends for this year and reveals what is on the radar of leading tech leaders\n\n[Digital Business](https://metait.ai/category/digital-business-en/), [Digital Transformation](https://metait.ai/category/digital-transformation-en/), [Partnerships](https://metait.ai/category/partnerships/)\n\n# Tech trends 2024\n\n20/03/2024\n\nMeta IT, a technology and innovation company focused on digital transformation and evolution, has released its 2024 Tech Trends report on technology market trends. The company surveyed top executives to understand industry outlooks and identify crucial areas for business growth. The Meta IT experts, Marcos Machado (Managing Director) and Simone Lettieri (CDO), were joined by other influential figures in the industry such as Gustavo Franca (Global CIO at [Gerdau](https://www2.gerdau.com/)), Alexandre Villeroy (CIO at [Acelen](https://ri.acelen.com.br/en/the-company/corporate-profile/)), Helio Matsumoto (CIO at Sicredi), Alexandre Telles (CIO at [Ajinomoto](https://www.ajinomoto.com/)), Lilian Hoffmann (Executive Director of Technologies and Innovation at BP), and Wanderley Baccala (Digital Hub Executive Director at Globo).\n\nThe report, accessible on their website [https://metait.ai/tech-trends-2024/](/tech-trends-2024/), highlights eight key trends shaping the year. Here\u2019s a quick overview of each:\n\n## More than just transformation, digital evolution\n\nThere is an ongoing need for continuous improvement. It\u2019s not just about efficiency, but also driving better experiences for both employees and customers. Digital evolution goes beyond technology, encompassing cultural and organizational shifts focused on people.\n\n\u201cEmbracing relevant trends and efficiently integrating them into daily operations is essential. Digital evolution represents a conscious and strategic journey towards tangible results, not just a passing trend,\u201d explains Marcos Machado, Managing Director at Meta IT.\n\n## The year of operational efficiency\n\n2024 is the year of operational efficiency; after all, adopting solutions that enable a company\u2019s evolution is important, but what truly makes a difference is not about having cutting-edge technology, but rather being aligned with customer needs and having an organizational culture compatible with the use of these technologies, fully leveraging them. The goal is to [streamline operations](/production-planning-sap/), maximize resource utilization, and ultimately [support a long-term evolutionary strategy](/solucoes/digital-strategy/).\n\n## Increasingly intelligent artificial intelligence\n\nFollowing a strong 2023, [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](/solucoes/process-automation-optimization/) remains a major focus. The report highlights its potential for driving experimentation, new opportunities, and innovation through generative AI, which can create original content and learn complex patterns.\n\n\u201cCompanies continue to recognize the role of technology as a facilitator in addressing business challenges that impact business, social, and environmental issues. In other words, innovations will not replace, but rather demand adaptation and improvement of human functions,\u201d emphasizes Simone Lettieri, CDO at Meta IT.\n\n## Digital Twins, the best of both worlds\n\n\u201cDigital twins\u201d are real-time virtual representations of physical objects or processes that allow for precise simulations and optimization, like in equipment operation. According to data from Grand View Research, the global market for this technology is expected to exceed $25 billion in revenue by 2025.\n\n## Automating processes means making work easier\n\n[Process automation](/solucoes/process-automation-optimization/) is about making people\u2019s work easier, but it is not just about that. The benefits of automation go far beyond, resulting in noticeable precision, with reduced errors and greater agility in task performance. It goes hand-in-hand with process optimization to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and meet customer demands.\n\n## The transformative power of quantum computing\n\nQuantum computing combines aspects of computing, physics, and mathematics, using quantum mechanics to solve complex problems much faster than traditional computers. There are already some promising applications of quantum computing that simulate supercomputers in commercial use with a focus on logistic optimization.\n\n## It\u2019s all about people, culture, work, and performance\n\nCompanies with higher digital maturity tend to invest more in automation and innovation that facilitates work. This is because [they have a culture that embraces technology](/hr-role-digital-transformation/), allowing employees and customers to collaborate more effectively.\n\n\u201cAt Meta IT, we believe digital transformation thrives on putting people first. Technology is our tool, but it\u2019s the human factor that unlocks its potential. This collaborative approach fuels operational efficiency and drives growth for our clients,\u201d concludes Marcos Machado, Managing Director at Meta IT.\n\nReady to learn about the latest tech trends beyond just AI?

Packed with reveals, updates, demonstrations, and some AI magic, Meta pulled out the stops to show the world what they\u2019re working on.\n\nSo, we at SideQuest have rounded up the 7key highlights from Meta Connect 2024 that we think you need to know about!\n\n# 1\\. Quest 3S launch\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*VDUf0y8xEa-7WfRrvVUQhA.png)\n\nLess than 2 minutes into the keynote presentation, Mark Zuckerberg revealed the Quest 3S\u2014 [possibly the most important VR headset launch in 2024](https://medium.com/sidequestvr/quest-3s-could-be-the-most-important-vr-headset-of-2024-4b8da943692a).\n\nWith [preorders](https://www.meta.com/gb/quest/quest-3s/) going live as soon as the keynote ended, the Quest 3S presents a more budget-friendly version of the flagship Quest 3 and will launch on **October 15** with prices starting at **$299** for the 128GB model and rising to **$399** for the 256GB model.\n\nAdditionally, all preorders and post-launch purchases (until announced otherwise) will come with a **3-month free trial of** [**Meta\u2019s Quest+** **subscription service**](https://www.meta.com/gb/meta-quest-plus/) and a free copy of the hotly anticipated [**Batman: Arkham Shadow**](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/). Additionally, if you [order Quest 3S through Meta](https://www.meta.com/gb/quest/quest-3s/), you\u2019ll get a **1-year limited warranty** on the device and its boxed contents.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*Eq12DgyqBffLHGfm.png)\n\nA comparison between pancake lenses found in the Quest 3 (left) and fresnel lenses found in Quest 2 and Quest 3S (right).\n\nRegarding specifications, the Quest 3S is similar to its bigger brother, the Quest 3, while including older elements from Quest 2 to keep the price low (looking at you, fresnel lenses!). However, the other specifications, including the all-important Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and 8GB RAM, are the same as those found in Quest 3. This means Quest 3S can play all the same apps and games as Quest 3\u2014including the same Mixed Reality experiences. Plus, almost all Quest 3 accessories from Meta and third-party suppliers, such as head straps and facial interfaces, will also fit the Quest 3S.\n\nWith Quest 3S now available from just $299, this could be the perfect time to upgrade from Quest 2 if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s a great-value deal for newcomers to VR as well\u2014or if you have another family member who wants to get into VR or play with you in local co-op. And, since the Quest 2 launched at the same price back in 2020 and went on to sell over 20 million units worldwide, we\u2019re confident that the Quest 3S will perform well\u2014and provide more users around the world with the most up-to-date standalone VR experiences and features.\n\n[You can read more about our thoughts on the Quest 3S right here](https://medium.com/sidequestvr/quest-3s-could-be-the-most-important-vr-headset-of-2024-4b8da943692a).\n\n# 2\\. Quest 3 price cut\u2014and discontinued 128GB model\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*bZ39lJpDLfSyDuJ-hx4aIg.png)\n\nCoinciding with the Quest 3S launch, Meta also dropped the RRP of the Quest 3 512GB model to just **$499.** Meanwhile, they have ceased shipping the 128GB model altogether.\n\nThe Quest 3 ecosystem now comprises:\n\n- 128GB Quest 3S ($299)\n- 256GB Quest 3S ($399)\n- 512GB Quest 3 ($499)\n\nNot only is this a nice, even pricing structure, it also means that the Quest 3 and Quest 3S are perhaps the best value standalone VR headsets on the market right now\u2014especially at the lowest and highest ends. These are both fantastic headsets, and Meta\u2019s competitors are probably rethinking their own pricing strategies as a result.\n\nThere\u2019s never been a better time to get into VR with such fantastic prices-to-value!\n\n# 3\\. Orion Augmented Reality glasses\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*yYK6TA17YJcUloZ5QJdNnA.png)\n\nPerhaps the highlight of the keynote address was the unexpectedly in-depth prototype reveal of [Meta\u2019s Orion AR glasses](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/orion)\u2014perhaps the most advanced pair of glasses the world has ever seen.\n\nFrom the outside, they look like any ordinary pair of (thicc) glasses, weighing only 98g and paired with a sleek black wristband and wireless puck (without which, the glasses will not work). However, there\u2019s a lot of technical wonder going on under the hood.\n\nThey were designed from the ground up to make communication and connection more accessible and fun, help you with daily tasks, play games, and be genuinely smart thanks to AI integration\u2014all while being genuinely comfortable and stylish to wear.\n\nIn Full: Mark Zuckerberg Reveals \"Orion\" Prototype AR Glasses - YouTube\n\nUploadVR\n\n92.9K subscribers\n\n[In Full: Mark Zuckerberg Reveals \"Orion\" Prototype AR Glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPLWIL64sgQ)\n\nUploadVR\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

When the time comes and Orion\u2019s consumer-ready successor goes on sale\u2014likely sometime in the next few years\u2014they might just accomplish that dream.\n\n[You can read more of our thoughts on Meta\u2019s Orion AR glasses right here](https://medium.com/sidequestvr/meta-unveils-orion-their-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses-23923badd528).\n\n# 4\\. Meta AI\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Yx3eGwWy7gaaFSP4-y0fbw.png)\n\nAI is all the rage these days\u2014and [Meta is no exception](https://ai.meta.com/). In fact, Connect 2024 focused on AI more than anything else, with the technology being mentioned in every segment of the keynote address and cropping up across many of the smaller talks and showcases over the 2 days. While it feels like a bit of a buzzword in tech\u2014and has done for a few years now\u2014Meta is actually doing some pretty cool (or creepy, depending on your outlook) stuff with AI\u2014especially in the wearables field\u2014that we need to talk about.\n\n## Total AI integration\n\nThis isn\u2019t \u2018new\u2019 news, but Meta is really pushing the power of AI across all of its platforms and products, especially in the form of its AI assistant, which is now powered by the [updated Llama 3.2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/)\u2014Meta\u2019s own LLM (Language Learning Model).\n\nTheir AI assistant is now fully integrated into WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, the latest generation of their Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and, of course, Quest headsets. You can ask it questions in real-time and, using your device and data, it will make recommendations depending on what you ask. Classic AI assistant stuff, then.\n\n## Better vocal interaction\n\nSlightly more impressive is the work Meta has been doing to improve vocal interactions with their AI assistant and make it feel more natural. They\u2019ve even gone so far as to add celebrity voices to its AI chatbots, including Awkwafina, John Cena, and even Dame Judi Dench if you prefer a touch of British sophistication.\n\nWith Mark Zuckerberg himself believing that vocal interaction with AI is far more natural than text and presents the future of the tech\u2019s development, these additions and updates are unsurprising.\n\n## Image interpretation\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*P2-OQ3MdF46B9TVJek2fbg.png)\n\nMore impressive, still, is their work on AI image interpretation, with the software able to recognize (in many cases) what you\u2019re looking at and answer questions based on what it sees\u2014amongst other things.\n\nThese updates pair perfectly with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest headsets\u2014and actually have a wide range of intriguing applications. You can look at an outfit laid out on your bed and ask how it would be accessorized. You can look at an animal and ask it for information about that animal. You can even look at your parking spot (if it\u2019s numbered) and ask the AI to remember where you parked for you.\n\nDuring the Orion glasses showcase, Meta also demonstrated the AI\u2019s powers of recognition by letting it scan a group of ingredients and then provide recommendations on what to cook. The days of staring blankly at the fridge are over, it seems! Apparently, they\u2019re also working on instant translation, so you won\u2019t get stuck ordering off a foreign menu, either.\n\nThis power of image recognition also extends to image editing. Since the AI (broadly speaking) knows what it\u2019s looking at, you can ask it to make changes and tweaks to images, too.\n\nTo allay any fears that this image recognition might be getting a bit too Black Mirror, Meta has stated that its recognition software will not work on humans. You won\u2019t be able to track or recognize individuals. This is evidently due to (well-considered) safety and security concerns.\n\nBut, while this is impressive, none of this is exactly \u2018new stuff\u2019.\n\n## Automatic video dubbing and live translation\n\nWhat is new\u2014and will surely come in very handy\u2014is the ability for AI to detect the original language of a reel or short-form video and dub it into your native language\u2014including an approximation of lip-synch. They\u2019re currently only experimenting with English and Spanish, but the demo was impressive and showcased the AI\u2019s ability to make an accurate dub, even when the content was spoken at speed.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*qkPzvDW4Zv91vEQz9Vobvg.png)\n\nYou may soon be able to break language barriers with AI.\n\nThese translation developments will even extend to live conversations over time\u2014as was also demonstrated during the keynote address. Zuckerberg was able to have a back-and-forth conversation in Spanish and English with a native speaker using the AI model integrated into the Ray-Bans they were both wearing. This is impressive stuff.\n\n## AI impersonation\u2026\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*gkak_ii0P2QAjd4wKiv-Aw.png)\n\nYeah\u2026 That\u2019s an AI.\n\nA final new feature (and definitely broke into Black Mirror territory\u2014for me at least) was their new AI face generation, as demonstrated by Don Allen Stevenson III and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nNot only have they trained the AI model to impersonate Stevenson to help respond to DMs, emails, and more in his written style, they\u2019ve fed it data on what he is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014knowledgeable about so that it can provide more \u2018Stevenson-accurate\u2019 responses based on his real-life skills and experience. He knows a lot about writing and tech, but not so much about mountain climbing, as was demonstrated.\n\nBut the kicker was when Zuckerberg hopped onto a \u2018video call\u2019 with an AI representation of Stevenson and had it answer no only in his voice, but with his speaking style and subtle movements\u2014and an approximation of his real-life knowledge, too.\n\nThis is cool. But it\u2019s also really creepy.\n\n# 5\\. Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses updates\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*aunxQ1IOI6RmWp0ZhgTNog.png)\n\n[Meta\u2019s collab with Ray-Ban](https://meta.com/gb/smart-glasses/shop-all/?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=ps&utm_campaign=20687046214&utm_term=meta+ray+bans&utm_content=714820859989&utm_funnel=dcap&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwgfm3BhBeEiwAFfxrG7pPs9bxcg7Txh6NMAoq_Nsml5PElXjeZUEidyRApRAsQLtkYM7rAhoC6mEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) has produced some pretty awesome, functional, and fashionable wearables so far\u2014with AI integration, video and photo cameras, and audio features that we\u2019ve been loving, alongside the ability to answer calls and texts\u2014and even get navigation assistance! And they\u2019re getting better still!\n\nA lot of these coming improvements will be in line with the AI advancements we\u2019ve already discussed above, but let\u2019s just summarize with: We can soon expect active recording, image, and object recognition, live translations, and more.\n\nMeta\u2019s AI integration with Ray-Bans has also expanded the app selection it\u2019s compatible with \u2014 especially when it comes to audio. If you\u2019re not a Spotify fan, you can also link up with Amazon Music, Audible, and more \u2014 with more promised over time.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Q314qNlGsRoORmh5_y6fSw.png)\n\nLimited edition clear frames Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nAdditionally, earlier product runs were difficult to get with transition lenses, but now there is a wider range available to suit your style, whether you want more traditional glasses or full-on shades. They\u2019re also releasing a limited \u2018clear frames\u2019 edition of the glasses.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not actually tried these smart glasses yet, we\u2019d recommend that you do! Alongside the fact that they\u2019re cool and stylish glasses you\u2019d want to wear anyway, the functionality of these things is actually useful and may well represent the future of wearables.\n\n# 6\\. Developers to be given access to camera passthrough API\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*8vJ940ycVdyV1intF8BbZw.png)\n\nWe\u2019re always excited by any reveal geared towards supporting developers\u2014and this one could be key for the future of app development in passthrough!\n\nWell, it appears Meta will finally be [granting developers access to their latest camera passthrough API](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculusdev/comments/1fq33l6/new_camera_passthrough_api_to_allow_some_amount/) (Application Programming Interface) from early next year, opening the doors to better apps and game development for Quest headsets.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear what form this will take, or how extensive this access will be, many developers will benefit from this as Meta has historically been very tight about camera access on Quest headsets due to privacy concerns.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to see Meta make a move showing they care about developer feedback!\n\n# 7\\. New Horizon avatars\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*FZzIVrUUHkXNjpqkSg9DDA.png)\n\nOut with the old and in with the new\u2014Meta\u2019s Horizon avatars are finally getting [the visual upgrade we\u2019ve been waiting for since 2022](https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-avatars-legs-graphics-overhaul/)!\n\nWhile introducing legs to their avatars was a popular move, there\u2019s always been something a little too \u2018uncanny valley\u2019 about the Horizon avatars. They were stiff. Not human enough. Not customizable enough. And I don\u2019t look anything like mine\u2026\n\nWell, now they\u2019re getting\u2026 better!?\n\nWith this [latest update](https://medium.com/sidequestvr/new-meta-vr-avatars-to-be-announced-at-meta-connect-2024-8615b053c5f9), Meta has made improvements to the avatars\u2019 visual style and included a suite of new options to help you fine-tune your look more than ever before. A particularly welcome change is greater control over body proportions\u2014something that the older avatars were severely lacking. Many of the options now include sliders so you have more control over your appearance, so your avatar should look more distinctive than ever before.\n\nHaving played around with it myself (and you can try it too by visiting the Horizon app now!), I like the changes, however, I wish there had been more updates to the wardrobe and hair options. The wardrobe is mostly the same as before, while the hair options (and especially facial hair) just leave much to be desired.\n\nIs it as good as the character creator in Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 or the latest Dragon Age? Absolutely not. But it\u2019s better than the old one, and you should have fun playing with it!\n\n# But, what about the games?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*sP0Z3y0hKpxwvrfQg2rr9A.png)\n\nMeta Connect 2024 was an AI-first event. While we got hands-on demos of the new Quest 3S and\u2014perhaps even more exciting\u2014the Orion AR glasses, the keynote, in particular, was really a showcase of Meta\u2019s AI advancements, what it can do, and how it is helping them build the future of wearable tech.\n\nIn particular, we can\u2019t wait to get hands-on with the live translation AI features\u2014being a global company, this will definitely come in handy at SideQuest! We\u2019re also very keen to follow the development of the Orion AR glasses\u2014hopefully, we\u2019ll have some consumer-ready products on the market sometime in the next 3 years!\n\nIn terms of games, there was a healthy buzz about upcoming apps and games launching before the end of 2024. With Quest 3S capable of running the same titles as Quest 3, anyone upgrading can look forward to more than [Batman: Arkham Shadow](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/)! We\u2019ve also got [Metro Awakening](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/metro-awakening-deluxe-edition/5096918017089406/) (November) and [Alien: Rogue Incursion](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/alien-rogue-incursion/24882487241367228/) (December) poised to deliver some thrilling chills. And you can play the newly-released [Starship Home](https://sidequestvr.com/app/38071/starship-home) right now, which is a very cozy title built entirely for Mixed Reality! You won\u2019t find any of these on Quest 2!\n\nHowever, regardless of these amazing games coming up, one thing we found lacking throughout the event was any news on developer visibility on the Horizon Store.\n\nSure, there were several presentations and demos geared towards assisting developers\u2014and granting developers access to their new camera passthrough API from early next year\u2014but we didn't get any updates on the state of the transition away from App Lab and how indie developers may be able to get more traction on the Horizon Store.\n\nSince App Lab was discontinued, developers were optimistic about Horizon Store restrictions relaxing, believing there would finally be a greater level of discovery for early access titles on the official storefront. However, this has not been the case and many developers we\u2019re in conversation with are incredibly frustrated by this\u2014and the lack of communication around it. Especially considering Meta seems to be promoting Horizon Worlds more than any other app right now\u2014just look at the Horizon Store homepage!\n\nWe hope they address this soon.\n\nOtherwise\u2026 What a show! We\u2019ve got loads to look forward to over the next year (and beyond)\u2014and plenty more adventures to have in eXtended Reality!\n\n# About SideQuest\n\nSideQuest is the ultimate community in standalone VR.

[Source](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/1525382954801931/)\n\nIn a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1525382954801931&vanity=zuck) posted on Facebook and [text](https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DEhgZJYJu5D) posted to Threads, today Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced sweeping changes to the company's approach to content moderation. After years of developing 'trust and safety' and content moderation systems and policies, Zuckerberg now asserts that \"we've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship.\" Zuckerberg has decided to return to a posture that he believes will prioritize free expression.\n\nSpecific policy changes announced include:\n\n- Eliminating fact-checkers in the US and replacing them with a \"community notes\" system similar to X (formerly Twitter);\n- \"Simplifying\" content policies by removing certain restrictions on topics like immigration and gender;\n- Changing enforcement approach for policy violations:\n  - Focusing automated filters only on illegal and high-severity violations;\n  - Requiring user reports before taking action on lower-severity violations;\n  - Increasing the confidence threshold required before removing content;\n  - Reintroducing civic and political content into recommendation systems on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads;\n  - Relocating trust and safety and content moderation teams from California to Texas. \"This will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Threads.\n\nZuckerberg says he is planning to work with President-elect Donald Trump to oppose global \"censorship\" pressures. He makes claims about such pressures mounting in multiple regions, including:\n\n- Europe's \"ever-increasing number of laws, institutionalizing censorship\";\n- Secret courts in Latin America that \"that can order companies to quietly take things down\";\n- Chinese censorship.\n\nHe further claims that the only way Meta \"can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government, and that's why it's been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship.\"\n\nZuckerberg's statement was timed with the [release of a post](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/) by Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan:\n\n> We want to undo the mission creep that has made our rules too restrictive and too prone to over-enforcement. We\u2019re getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate. It\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.\n\nNotably, Kaplan says the company is now deploying \"AI large language models (LLMs) to provide a second opinion on some content before we take enforcement actions.\"\n\nTimed with the announcement, Kaplan also provided an \"exclusive\" [interview](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/meta-ends-fact-checking-program-zuckerberg-vows-restore-free-expression-facebook-instagram) with the Fox News morning program \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\n_Below is a transcript of Zuckerberg's remarks, followed by a transcript of the Kaplan appearance on Fox & Friends:_\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg:**\n\nHey everyone. I want to talk about something important today because it's time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram. I started building social media to give people a voice. I gave a speech at Georgetown five years ago about the importance of protecting free expression, and I still believe this today, but a lot has happened over the last several years.\n\nThere's been widespread debate about the potential harms from online content. Governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more. A lot of this is clearly political, but there's also a lot of legitimately bad stuff out there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation. These are things that we take very seriously, and I want to make sure that we handle responsibly. So we built a lot of complex systems to moderate content, but the problem with complex systems is they make mistakes even if they accidentally censor just 1% of posts.\n\nThat's millions of people, and we've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech. So, we're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. More specifically, here's what we're going to do.\n\nFirst, we're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US. After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US. So, over the next couple of months, we're going to phase in a more comprehensive community notes system.\n\nSecond, we're going to simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse. What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it's gone too far. So, I want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms.\n\nThird, we're changing how we enforce our policies to reduce the mistakes that account for the vast majority of censorship on our platforms. We used to have filters that scanned for any policy violation. Now, we're going to focus those filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations, and for lower-severity violations, we're going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take action. The problem is that the filters make mistakes, and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn't. So, by dialing them back, we're going to dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms. We're also going to tune our content filters to require much higher confidence before taking down content. The reality is that this is a trade-off. It means we're going to catch less bad stuff, but we'll also reduce the number of innocent people's posts and accounts that we accidentally take down.\n\nFourth, we're bringing back civic content. For a while, the community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed, so we stopped recommending these posts, but it feels like we're in a new era now, and we're starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again. So we're going to start phasing this back into Facebook, Instagram, and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. Fifth, we're going to move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, and our US-based content review is going to be based in Texas. As we work to promote free expression, I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.\n\nFinally, we're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world. They're going after American companies and pushing to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world. Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws, institutionalizing censorship, and making it difficult to build anything innovative there. Latin American countries have secret courts that can order companies to quietly take things down. China has censored our apps from even working in the country. The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government, and that's why it's been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship.\n\nBy going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further. But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I'm excited to take it. It'll take time to get this right, and these are complex systems. They're never going to be perfect. There's also a lot of illegal stuff that we still need to work very hard to remove. But the bottom line is that after years of having our content moderation work focused primarily on removing content, it is time to focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our systems, and getting back to our roots about giving people voice. I'm looking forward to this next chapter. Stay good out there, and more to come soon.\n\n#### _Transcript of Joel Kaplan appearance on Fox and Friends, January 7, 2025._\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nAll right, buckle up. We got a Fox News alert moments ago. Meta the parent company of Facebook and Instagram announcing they are changing their policies to focus on free speech. CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying this.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg:**\n\nWe're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. More specifically, we're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nWow, this is a big deal. Changes include ending its third-party fact-checking program and lifting restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nWell, is there anything more important to talk about? Also, until now, meta used automated systems to scan for violations, but found they resulted in too much censorship. So from now on, they'll focus on tackling illegal and severe violations like terrorism fraud to name a few.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nAnd joining us right now to name one Fox and Friends exclusive, met as Chief Global Affairs Officer, Joel Kaplan joins us live here on the couch. Joel, welcome.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nThanks. Great to be here on the couch on Fox and Friends.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nIt's great to have you. You here? Okay, so you are announcing these big changes as of two minutes ago. If you're making big changes, does that mean you were doing something wrong before?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nLook, this is a great opportunity for us to reset the balance in favor of free expression. As Mark says in that video, what we're doing today is we're getting back to our roots in free expression. There's a number of changes we're making, but if I could, and just highlight three first is, as you heard, we're eliminating the third-party fact-checking system. Well-intentioned at the outset, but there's just been too much political bias in what they choose to fact-check and how, so we're just scrapping it entirely.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nYou say \"they,\" what do you mean? You mean \"you.\"\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nThe fact-checkers.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nYou set up your, but they're your fact-checkers, right?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nSo the idea was they're independent, but they've just been too biased. And so what we're going to do instead is adopt a system like X has of community notes. So we're just going to rely on our own community of users to provide people more information about what they're seeing and we think that's going to work great.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nSo give us an example. If we said, if the headline is Donald Trump won the presidency, then anyone in the community can write notes underneath it.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, great question. So somebody can write a note and then the way it works is different people on the platform can sort of vote on that note. And if you get people who usually disagree who all say, yeah, that sounds right, then that note gets put on the post and people see it. X has been doing it for a while, we think it's working really well, and we're going to adopt that system.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nAnd what are the other ones you want? I know you want to go through.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nThank you. So the second one is about the rules that govern content on our platform. They've just become too restrictive over time about what people can say, including about those kind of sensitive topics that you mentioned that people want to discuss and debate. Immigration, trans issues, gender. We want to make it so that bottom line, if you can say it on tv, you can say it on the floor of Congress. You certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship. So we're changing those rules. And then the last thing, if I could, we're also going to change how we enforce the rules and we're going to make it so that there's way less over-enforcement and way fewer mistakes that actually make up the vast majority of censorship that people experience on our platforms. So big changes all in service of getting us back to our values of free expression.\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nSo Joel, I guess the big question is where are the changes coming from? Because I mean, it's hard not to notice there's been a change in Mark Zuckerberg. You've seen him as respectfully the nerdy kid, change over to the jujitsu. He's put on some lean muscles. His viewpoints have changed, his posting content. When he does speak, he's meeting with Trump, taking a different stance on certain things. Are these changes coming from him or from what the public is saying?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, there's no question that the things that happen at Met are coming from Mark, but there's also no question that there has been a change over the last four years. We saw a lot of societal and political pressure all in the direction of more content moderation, more censorship, and we've got a real opportunity now. We've got a new administration and a new president coming in who are big defenders of free expression, and that makes a difference. One of the things we've experienced is that when you have a US president administration that's pushing for censorship, it just makes it open season for other governments around the world that don't even have the protections of the First Amendment to really put pressure on US companies. We're going to work with President Trump to push back on that kind of thing around the world.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nSo Joel, why now? I know you said it's a change, but did you feel restricted over the last four years and this is the first time you have, it's in your business interests to express this quest for freedom?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, there's no question that there's an opportunity here with a new president taking office, as I said, who really believes in free expression. And that's just going to give us the space to get back to those values that Mark has talked about for a long mark gave a big speech six years ago at Georgetown about free expression, about these values. Unfortunately, there's been a lot of political and societal pressure here and around the world that have pushed away from those values. We've got a real opportunity to reset, get back to them, and really provide a space for how.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nHow was the Biden administration putting pressure on you specifically? Where they calling where they didn't like a post? What did they say? Take it down.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah. So Mark talked about this in a letter he sent to the House judiciary committee a few months ago that sort of outlined the way in which we got a lot of pressure around Covid in particular to take down more content, even things like humor and satire about the pandemic and about vaccines. So we did experience that kind of pressure. The decisions we made ultimately were our own. But there's a real opportunity here with President Trump coming into office with his commitment to free expression for us to get back to those values and really provide space for people to have the kind of discourse and debate they want to have.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nWould you do what X did? And that is unleash independent journalists like Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger onto, forensically, go through what you guys, or actually repressing, shielding, shadow banning over the last few years. Wouldn't that be part of this cleansing process?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nSo we've had an opportunity to do a lot of that with the House Judiciary Committee and Chairman Jordan over the last few months and years. And he put out a really thorough report on the experience that we and other companies have had. Honestly, we're pretty focused on the future and the opportunity we have right now with the changes we're making today to really open up the space for debate and expression on our platform.\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nIs the idea to get out of politics. Totally. And focus on just the enterprise of the free market. People debating things, or is it for Mark Zuckerberg to become Elon Musk and be influential as well work with the next administration or a little bit of both? I don't know.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, Mark's always going to be Mark Zuckerberg, but I think there is a real opportunity to work with the new administration, both on free expression, but also on American leadership and technology and innovation. This is something we've seen President Trump is really focused on making sure that we maintain US competitiveness and leadership on technology, things like ai. Those are obviously super important to our company and our industry, and we'll look forward to working with the new administration to advance those goals.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nAnd Joel, when you talk about content moderation, I think a lot of people watching right now are going, well, it sounds better if they're not taking instructions from the federal government, the Joe Biden administration saying, Hey, this is wrong. Take that down. So people like the idea that they're going to have a say where you can add the community notes going forward, but ultimately, is this one of the things you are doing as a company to make sure that Meta and the other social media companies aren't regulated by Washington? The last thing you guys want.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah. I think when it comes to expression, especially in the United States, we got a long tradition of the First Amendment and we think that the right thing is for individual users to have the ability to decide themselves what to say. Look, there's bad stuff that people do online like they do in the real world, and we want to make sure we don't have that. So we're still going to be enforcing against terrorism and drug sales and child sexual exploitation things. Everybody agrees have no business being on our platform.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nWhat about bullying all the young little girls? I remember, mark, remember he was on the Hill and he had apo.... he was kind enough to turn around and apologize to the families, but all those families have lost their kids from bullying. I have a nine-year-old, I'm starting to get concerned because eventually when she's in high school or even after, she'll be faced with these situations. So what do you say to those families?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, well, I'm a parent of two teenagers.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nGosh, you're in it.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, I'm in it. So these are issues that I take really seriously and that a lot of my colleagues who are also parents at Meta and those who aren't parents take really seriously. We got to make sure teens are protected online. We launched a few months ago a product called Teen Accounts that really puts parents in the driver's seat and makes it so that they can see what their kids can see and do online, who can contact them. We put kids in sort of built in default settings, the most protective settings we have. And then if you're under 16, you can't change those settings on Instagram without your parents' permission. We think that's a really good innovation and something we're hopeful. It's an area where Congress can act.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nHow do we do that setting? How do the parents find that setting on the phone before they give it to their child?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, so we will send notifications basically to the parents to let them know that this opportunity exists and the kid can't sign up for Facebook, or excuse me, for Instagram without being put into a teen account. And then their parent gets a notice and says, Hey, your kid's trying to sign up and if you want to change any of the settings, you can do it here.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nSo Joel, what you got to do is reestablish trust. I mean, people remember the Zuckerbucks into those key areas in 2020 that were deciding what candidate was going to win what state. And one of the reasons you are trying to do that is number one, making this announcement here. The other thing is changing your board to let people know maybe by the people that you're hiring that you asked to join, that their agenda doesn't match maybe the 2020 agenda. What have you done?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, we made a big announcement yesterday. Put three new board members on, great board members including Dana White, the president and CEO of UFC, guy's a legend, an incredible businessman, incredible entrepreneur, marketing genius, super excited to have him. A couple other great board members with real deep business experience that we put on the board. So those are important voices. Mark has always been great about getting different perspectives so that we sort of cover the waterfront of ideas and perspectives that we want to make sure are getting fed into the process.\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nJoel, can you tell the audience and the world that this is not a temporary stance? And what I mean by that is this just because you got Donald Trump in there for four years, are you guys going to continue this after his presidency or is this just a temporary thing for the moment?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nThis is an opportunity for us to get back to the values that Mark founded the company on. This runs deep for Mark. It's a great opportunity to rebalance and to get back to free expression.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nWhen you say rebalance, historically the big tech companies and social media companies have leaned to the left that is this dragging it closer to the center. I mean with Dana White, obviously a Trump ally as part of the board. Is the company becoming more central rather than leaning to one side or the other?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nI think the way to look at it is we are a platform for all people and all ideas.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nI know, but some people don't feel that certain and haven't felt historically that certain social media companies were hospitable to their points of view.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nNo question. And that's what I meant by rebalance. We want to make sure that they understand that their views are welcome and that we're providing a space for them to come onto our platforms, engage, express themselves, engage in the important issues of the day or not in the important issues today, and just whatever it is they want to talk about and share. And so we need to make sure they feel welcome. We need to make sure we rebuild trust, and that's a big part of what we're doing today.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nSo also there's something else could be in front of the Supreme Court and that's future of TikTok China controlled. So you're an American company, you decide to make this announcement. How does this relate to what TikTok could possibly do?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nSo look, we like competition. We think it makes us better. I know there are concerns that Congress has expressed and that the President and Congress and the courts are working through With TikTok, we're going to stay focused on what we're doing and how we make our platform as open and welcoming a place as possible for all points of view.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nDo you think it should be banned?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, that's something I'm going to leave to the president and the courts in Congress. We're focused, again, we're focused on what we can do to make our platforms the best they can be.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nIf Elon Musk didn't buy X and expose what he exposed and put community notes like that, do you think we'd be in? What did he in buying this and doing what he did do for the introspection that Facebook is showing right now?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nI think Elon's played an incredibly important role in moving the debate and getting people refocused on free expression. And that's been really constructive and productive, and we're just glad that we've got the opportunity now to make these kind of changes and to get back to our roots in free expression.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nMaybe all social media companies can learn a lot from this, because y'all were the original, mark was one of the originals at least. And so y'all have had to see all the changes in what works and what doesn't work and what Americans really want. So thank you for your honesty. Thank you for doing this for children and all your customers.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nAustralia has banned social media up until you're 16 years old. How do you feel about that?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWe think the right way to do it is to trust parents. That's what we're doing with the teen accounts that I mentioned. And obviously we've got to work with governments and follow the laws that they pass, but I think there's a better way, and that's to put parents in charge. They know what's best for their teens and their kids, and that's what we're trying to do.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nWhat's your biggest customer? What age group?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nOh, that's a good question. I mean, we've got 3.2 billion people using our services, so we really have people across all ages and we want to make sure we're serving them all and letting them express themselves in a way, especially with teens where they're still kept safe.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nDid you talk to David Sacks about this? Who's going to be coming in as the AI czar?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, we've talked to David. We're really excited about that post. We think he's going to do great things. He really understands the industry. He really understands crypto and AI, and we can't wait to start working with him.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nWell, Joel, thank you very much for stopping by the couch and making a big announcement today.\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nHopefully you'll come back as well.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you all for having me.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nA fair and balanced social media world. There you go. Thank you so much.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nThank you. Nice to meet you.\n\n## Authors\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/3tzzh18d/production/13e89d005fe677a1c18c1b8be04209d7849a7de8-748x748.jpg?fit=max&auto=format)\n\n[Justin Hendrix](/author/justin-hendrix)\n\nJustin Hendrix is CEO and Editor of Tech Policy Press, a nonprofit media venture concerned with the intersection of technology and democracy.

As of December 2024, Meta's market capitalization stands at approximately $1.48 trillion, making it the [world's 7th most valuable company](https://companiesmarketcap.com/meta-platforms/marketcap/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). With a market capitalization surpassing $1 trillion as of 2024 and over [3 billion monthly active users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) across its platforms, Meta\u2019s influence is undeniably strong. But this success isn\u2019t just driven by its widespread social media reach or its ambitious Metaverse vision. Here's an inside look at Meta\u2019s financial growth journey and how the company is revolutionizing the digital economy.\n\n### The Early Expansions\n\nMeta's journey toward global tech dominance began with its public debut in 2012, raising $16 billion in an IPO that valued the company at $104 billion. By the end of that year, [Facebook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebook-reaches-1-billion-users/2012/10/04/5edfefb2-0e14-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_story.html) (before merging into Meta) had surpassed 1 billion users. In the following years, Facebook's growth was driven by strategic acquisitions, such as [Instagram](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/) for $1 billion in 2012, strengthening its presence in photo-sharing, and [WhatsApp](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/10/06/facebook-closes-19-billion-whatsapp-deal/) for $19 billion in 2014, expanding its mobile messaging capabilities. These acquisitions set the stage for the rebranding of Facebook's virtual reality division as \"Facebook Reality Labs\" in 2016, reflecting a growing commitment to AR and VR technologies. As Zuckerberg began to focus on the long-term potential of the Metaverse, Meta committed to pouring over $10 billion into [Meta\u2019s Reality Labs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse) division, positioning it at the forefront of the next wave of internet innovation.\n\n### The Stock and Investor Surge\n\nDue to Meta\u2019s impressive long-term growth potential as a leading AI tech company, investors have been flocking to the strategically restructured company. [Analysts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/10/whats-behind-the-80-rise-in-meta-stock/) noted that Meta\u2019s combination of AI-powered advertising tools and its growth in immersive technologies make it a compelling investment, thus resulting in a [80% stock increase](https://investor.atmeta.com/home/default.aspx) in 2024. Additionally, Meta\u2019s commitment to enhancing its [AR/VR hardware](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/how-meta-is-dominating-the-ar-vr-market-amid-global-demand) and software has placed it at the forefront of the immersive technology industry. Looking ahead, Meta\u2019s stock is expected to average around [$697.66](https://coincodex.com/stock/META/price-prediction/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in 2025, which is a 19% increase compared to the company\u2019s stock price in 2024. Meta's strong financial performance and positive analyst forecasts have significantly enhanced investor confidence, positioning the company for continued success in the evolving digital landscape.\n\n### The Advertising Juggernaut\n\nDespite Meta\u2019s growing focus on the Metaverse, its advertising business remains the core of its revenue model. By utilizing their digital advertising platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp, Meta is able to provide advertisers hyper-targeted ads across diverse demographics, which is key to its success. Despite challenges from big competitors like [Google and Tiktok,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/10/whats-behind-the-80-rise-in-meta-stock/) Meta\u2019s advertising revenue exceeded [$130 billion](https://investor.atmeta.com/financials/) in 2024, solidifying its position as a leading player in the global digital advertising market. This advertising strength continues to be the primary driver of Meta's financial growth, even as it pushes into new frontiers like the Metaverse and immersive digital experiences. As long as Meta can continue to innovate and provide value to advertisers, its advertising business will remain a critical pillar of its overall strategy.\n\nMeta's journey offers valuable lessons for businesses in any industry, especially when it comes to staying ahead of digital trends and diversifying revenue streams. By strategically diversifying its revenue streams and heavily investing in emerging technologies, Meta has positioned itself at the forefront of the digital economy. The company's robust 2024 performance, with a [19% year-over-year revenue increase](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/14/ai-powers-metas-strong-q3-growth-profits-soar/), highlights its resilience despite significant investments in new sectors. Additionally, their confidence in the Metaverse fostered a strong investment source, serving as reminder for B2B companies to prioritize long-term growth initiatives. By embracing these strategies, growth-seeking companies can not only survive but thrive in an increasingly digital and competitive landscape.\n\nAs a leading tech platform, Cake assists professionals looking to break through the startup scene and experienced startups searching for potential growth expansion strategies.

President-elect Donald Trump has been [especially critical](/news/2024/7/13/meta-lifts-restrictions-on-trumps-facebook-instagram), accusing its platforms of censoring conservative viewpoints.\n\nIn an August letter to the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, [Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg](/news/2024/8/27/did-bidens-white-house-pressure-mark-zuckerberg-to-censor-covid-content) said he regretted some content take-downs the company made in response to pressure from the Biden administration.\n\nIn Clegg\u2019s news briefing, he said Zuckerberg hoped to help shape President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration on tech policy, including AI.\n\nClegg said he was not privy to whether Zuckerberg and Trump discussed the tech platform\u2019s content moderation policies when Zuckerberg was invited to Trump\u2019s Florida resort last week.\n\n\u201cMark is very keen to play an active role in the debates that any administration needs to have about maintaining America\u2019s leadership in the technological sphere \u2026 and particularly the pivotal role that AI will play in that scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies\n\n* * *\n\n[iframe](https://www.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/enterprise/anchor?ar=1&k=6Lf6jaYoAAAAAGKN21DTkapV5mrMYJ9fA95UN8DN&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=zIriijn3uj5Vpknvt_LnfNbF&size=invisible&cb=nb4nqd8w7i8g)",

[Facebook changed its name to Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) and Zuckerberg set his sights on a new horizon, the metaverse.\n\n\u201cThere was genuinely a need and a desire at the time for Facebook, the company, to rebrand into something else,\u201d said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst and director at CCS Insight. \u201cThe company Facebook wanted to make clear that it was more than just that one social website.\u201d\n\nWhile the term metaverse predates Facebook, Zuckerberg\u2019s metaverse ambitions have existed inside Meta since 2014, when Facebook bought virtual reality headset developer Oculus and [launched Reality Labs](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/celebrating-10-years-of-reality-labs/). Seven years and a global pandemic later, global video game industry revenue topped [$193 billion](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/media-entertainment/what-s-possible-for-the-gaming-industry-in-the-next-dimension#:~:text=exceeded%20%24193%20billion). Meta \u2014 and Wall Street \u2014 saw an opportunity to capitalize on an increasing online population, riding in on a virtual reality headset wave.\n\n\u201cThere was a bit of a sense in 2020 and into 2021 that this was a technology that was ready, that it was finally going to hit the big time,\u201d said Gebbie. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of false dawns in virtual reality in the past.\u201d\n\nIn December 2021, [Horizon Worlds launched in the U.S.](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/horizon-worlds-open-in-us-and-canada/) and marked Meta\u2019s entrance into the open-world virtual reality platform space. Meta had a short-term goal of [500,000 monthly active users](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-metaverse-horizon-worlds-zuckerberg-facebook-internal-documents-11665778961) in Horizon Worlds by the end of the year. But its long-term goals were more ambitious. In June 2022, Zuckerberg told CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer that he expected [one billion users by the end of the decade,](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html) doing \u201chundreds of dollars of e-commerce each.\u201d\n\nThe company has a very long way to go.\n\nAn insider report [published by The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-metaverse-horizon-worlds-zuckerberg-facebook-internal-documents-11665778961) in 2022 found that Horizon Worlds had only around 200,000 monthly active users less than a year after launch. And now, three years later, the term metaverse has largely disappeared from the public conversation, with [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Metaverse&amp;hl=en) noting a sharp fall in searches for the term after 2022.\n\nTo make matters worse, Reality Labs is hemorrhaging cash, racking up [$58 billion in operating losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/metas-reality-labs-posts-4point4-billion-loss-in-third-quarter.html#:~:text=Quarterly%20losses%20for%20Meta's%20Reality%20Labs&amp;text=for%20$2%20billion.-,Facebook%20co-founder%20and%20Meta%20CEO%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20believes%20developing,a%20starting%20price%20of%20$499.) since 2020.\n\nMeta didn\u2019t respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment.\n\nWhat happened to the metaverse?

This was a year of pushing our products forward while adding helpful new features and working to keep people safe across our platforms.\n\nThese highlights provide a quick overview of some of the year\u2019s biggest accomplishments as we gear up for 2025.\n\n## Looking Forward With Open Source AI, Orion and More\n\n[![A drawing of glasses facing charts and graphs](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Orion.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Orion.png) In 2024, we introduced [Meta AI](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-ai-assistant-built-with-llama-3/), an AI assistant that we believe to be the most advanced one available for free.\n\n[![A drawing of a human-like Llama wearing glasses and a blue scarf](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Llama.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Llama.png)\n\nBuilt using Llama, our open source AI model, Meta AI can be used across Meta\u2019s apps to help you get things done, learn, create and connect with the things and people that matter to you. It can help you plan a trip, study and more, and it\u2019s on track to be the world\u2019s most used AI assistant by the end of the year, with nearly 600 million monthly active users.\n\nEarlier this year, our Founder & CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, [wrote an open letter](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/) about open source AI\u2019s potential to effect meaningful change. With more than 650 million downloads, Llama has become a popular choice in the open source community. [![A drawing of a planet that looks like Saturn](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Threads-Fediverse.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Threads-Fediverse.png) We\u2019ve seen [companies employing Llama](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/how-companies-are-using-meta-llama/) to build technology for the public good, from [localizing educational material](https://ai.meta.com/blog/foondamate-study-aid-education-llama/) to [increasing access to medical information](https://ai.meta.com/blog/bimedix-built-with-llama/) in low-resource communities.\n\nIn addition to AI, we made industry-leading advancements in AR when we introduced [Orion](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/), our first true AR glasses prototype, a key part of our vision to build the next computing platform that puts people at the center so they can be more present, connected and empowered in the world. [![A drawing of a planet highlighting different server locations on different continents](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Expansion.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Expansion.png) We also released [Meta Quest 3S](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/meta-quest-3s-our-most-affordable-mixed-reality-headset/), our most affordable mixed reality headset yet, and brought to market new styles and smart features for [Ray-Ban Meta glasses](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/ray-ban-meta-glasses-new-ai-features-and-partner-integrations/), like helping you remember where you parked and answering questions based on what you\u2019re looking at.\n\nAnd we made significant progress integrating Threads into the [fediverse](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/what-is-the-fediverse/), a global social network of interoperable servers.\n\n## Adding the Features You Asked For\n\n[![A drawing of a storefront](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_WA-Conversations.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_WA-Conversations.png)\n\nWe\u2019re always looking to enhance your experience across our family of apps by adding features that continually raise the bar, and this year was no different.\u00a0[![A drawing of a woman surrounded by objects/symbols of different technological functions, including a coffee cup and a light bulb](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Assistant.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Assistant.png)\n\nFor WhatsApp, we [improved call quality](https://www.instagram.com/metanewsroom/p/DDfDAW-RkNA/) and made in-group calling more flexible, plus we introduced [enhanced AI features](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/new-ai-tools-meta-verified-and-more-for-businesses-on-whatsapp/) for business chats and a new way to [schedule events](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/events-in-whatsapp-communities/). Over on Threads, we added exciting new [web features](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/08/new-threads-features-for-creators-and-businesses/) to help businesses and creators get the most out of the platform \u2013 insights, post scheduling and multiple drafts.\n\n[![A drawing of a light bulb](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_Threads-Insights.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_Threads-Insights.png)We also focused on making sure your experience on Instagram reflects you \u2013 who you are, what you want to see and what you create.\n\n[![An illustration of the Facebook logo surrounded by symbols of interactivity, including a painter's palette and a bicycle](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_FBIRL.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_FBIRL.png) In addition to features allowing you to [edit DMs and pin chats](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/03/instagram-dm-updates/), we introduced new [ways to connect](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/new-ways-to-connect-through-dms/) through Instagram DMs, including nicknames and location sharing, making Instagram an even more vibrant place to connect.\n\n[![An illustration of photographs symbolizing Instagram surrounded by several symbols of different functions a user might add to their algorithm, for instance a musical note](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Stickers.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Stickers.png)\n\nWe know people want to be able to shape their experience on Instagram as their interests and passions change, which is why we started testing a new way to [reset the recommendations](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/introducing-recommendations-reset-instagram/) you see on Instagram\u2019s Explore, Reels and Feed. And for creators, Instagram\u2019s new [trial reels](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/12/trial-reels-try-content-non-followers-first-see-what-perfoms-best/) let creators show your reels to non-followers first to test how they perform.\n\n## Keeping Our Platforms Safe\n\n[![A drawing of a teen surrounded by symbols of interactivity, communication and safety, for instance a lock and Meta's chat-bubble symbol for messaging](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Teen-Accounts-1.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Teen-Accounts-1.png)\n\nIn 2024, we stayed vigilant about security and safety, adapting our platforms for an evolving digital landscape.\n\nWe introduced Instagram [Teen Accounts](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/), giving teens built-in protections which limit who can contact them and the content they see. [![An illustration of a paintbrush painting white over a number of different scenes, such as a living room](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Reccomendation-Reset.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Reccomendation-Reset.png) We [launched a new education campaign](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/instagram-campaign-protect-teens-sextortion-scams) to help teens and parents spot sextortion scams and we [collaborated with](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/preventing-suicide-and-self-harm-content-spreading-online/) experts and peers to help prevent the spread of suicide and self-harm content online.\n\nTo help stop celeb-bait ads and speed up account recovery, we began [testing facial recognition technology](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/testing-combat-scams-restore-compromised-accounts/). [![A smartphone showing different functions as physical buttons, like a video camera and the chat/Messenger icon](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Messenger-E2EE-1-e1735066121158.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Messenger-E2EE-1-e1735066121158.png) This innovative, easy verification method ensures the right person accesses the right account. And we\u2019re protecting communications between you and the people important to you.

The six new objectives are: sales, leads, engagement, app promotion, traffic and awareness.\n\nWhile some ad objectives have been consolidated and campaign creation steps have changed as a result, all the same functionality is available. Starting in January 2024, you\u2019ll no longer be able to duplicate or import campaigns, ad sets, and ads using the original objectives. You also won\u2019t be able to create new ad sets or ads within existing campaigns that use the original objectives. Later in 2024, the original objectives will no longer be available for new or existing campaigns.\n\n## How to select a simplified ad objective based on your original objective\n\nSince the 11 ad objectives are consolidated into 6, some of the original objectives are no longer standalone, and are instead available as settings or optimization tactics under the simplified objectives. For example, the original objective \u2018video views\u2019 is now available as an optimization tactic under the simplified awareness and engagement objectives. Choose the simplified objective that best matches your business goal. So, if your goal is to improve awareness with video, select the awareness objective. If your goal is to get more views, select the engagement objective.\n\nBelow is a helpful table that shows how each previous, original objective in the left-hand column maps to a new, simplified objective in the right-hand column.\n\n| Original ads objective name | Simplified ads objective name |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Brand awareness | Awareness |\n| Reach | Awareness |\n| Traffic | Traffic |\n| Engagement | Engagement |\n| App installs | App promotion |\n| Video views | Awareness<br>Engagement |\n| Lead generation | Leads |\n| Messages | Engagement<br>Leads |\n| Conversions | Engagement<br>Leads<br>Sales |\n| Catalog sales | Sales |\n| Store traffic | Awareness |\n\nLearn more about [how to choose the right ad objective in Meta Ads Manager](/business/help/1438417719786914).\n\n## Updates to objective names, ad set options and campaign results\n\nCompared to the previous 11 objectives, the current set of 6 objectives affect objective names, ad set options and how we display certain campaign results.\n\n- **Current objective names:** You can now choose from among six ad objectives: awareness, traffic, engagement, leads, app promotion and sales. Some of the previous objectives have been combined with the new objectives.\n\n- **New ad set options:** Some of the previous objectives are now available as a feature or optimization setting when you create your ad set. For example, the previous objective of reach is now available by choosing the awareness objective and selecting reach as an optimization setting. Other previous objectives are available as a conversion location. The conversion location is the place where you want people to take action. For example, the previous objective of messages is now available by choosing the engagement objective and selecting messaging apps as the [conversion location](/business/help/1431172887335181).\n\n- **Campaign results display:** Some of the current objectives generate different reporting metrics versus previous objectives, and the two sets cannot always be compared. Depending on the objective you use for your campaigns, you may [view results in Ads Manager](/business/help/318580098318734) that appear either blank or as a dash in the results column of the campaign tab. Results in the ad set and ad tabs will not be affected.\n\n\n## Next steps for campaigns that use the previous objectives\n\nIn January 2024, changes to Ads Manager will impact your ability to use the original objectives. To prepare for these upcoming changes, you can begin using the current six objectives for all new campaigns and [proactively convert existing campaigns through

Trump and major social media platforms have been warring for years over perceived anti-conservative bias, including Meta\u2019s decision to shutter Trump\u2019s accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nWhile the latest moves look like corporate self-preservation in a vindictive political environment, they also reflect stubborn realities about stewarding a global public square \u2014 and they will reverberate around the world in ways that could fundamentally reshape the possibilities of a truly global digital platform.\n\nThe [changes Zuckerberg announced](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-01-07/meta-follows-x-playbook-on-fact-checking-heres-what-it-means-for-you) are sweeping. Meta will do away with the U.S. third-party fact-checking program in favor of mimicking X\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d model of crowd-sourced corrections. Except for the most severe types of [unlawful or dangerous content](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/), such as \u201cterrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams,\u201d the company will drop reliance on automated systems to flag potential violations, instead leaving it up to users to report objections when they spot a policy breach. Meta will err on the side of leaving up content that does not violate the law or otherwise foster offline harm, and loosen speech restraints on political subjects including immigration and gender identity. Corporate teams that oversee trust and safety will relocate from California to Texas \u201c [and other U.S. locations](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/),\u201d presumably to reflect more mainstream \u2014 meaning red state \u2014 political sensibilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[![Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg turns to address the audience during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024, to discuss child safety.

Updates on Tuesday to the company\u2019s [hateful conduct policy](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/hateful-conduct/), part of its \u201cCommunity Standards,\u201d narrowed its definition of \u201cdehumanizing speech.\u201d They eliminated prior bans on, for example, likening people to feces and on speech denying the existence of protected characteristics such as religious affiliations and gender identities. After years of campaigning for more and updated internet regulations, Meta leadership is now [pledging to work with the Trump administration](https://wchstv.com/news/nation-world/meta-will-work-with-trump-to-counter-censorship-global-affairs-officer-says-joel-kaplan-community-notes-facebook-instagram-mark-zuckerberg) to ward off guardrails around the world, repudiating Biden-era efforts to curtail disinformation and online abuse. Dana White, a Trump ally and the Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive, is [joining Meta\u2019s board](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/nx-s1-5250310/meta-dana-white-ufc).\n\nWhile the policy changes are tailored to U.S. politics, Meta\u2019s community standards apply globally, with some variation to comply with local laws that require more content to be taken down than do the company\u2019s own rules. International users and civil society organizations have long chafed at social media platforms\u2019 orientation around American priorities. They have decried the scarcity of content moderators fluent in foreign languages and companies\u2019 failure to invest adequately in local cultural competence. In adjudicating content amid conflicts including the Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, Meta is regularly accused of willful blindness; the company\u2019s platforms have been accused of reducing engagement with [Palestinian news outlets](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c786wlxz4jgo) and [enabling](https://kyivindependent.com/metas-ban-on-russian-propaganda-doesnt-go-far-enough-say-disinformation-experts/) the spread of Russian state-sponsored disinformation.\n\nThese latest changes confirm that while Meta claims billions of users worldwide, at least for now the audience that matters most resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The relocation of trust and safety teams to Texas risks trading years of expertise in grappling with global moderation dilemmas for an uncertain bid to have a finger on the pulse of what\u2019s assumed to be middle America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[![FILE - In this Thursday, Sept. 22, 2016, file photo, the LinkedIn logo is displayed during a product announcement in San Francisco.

Here\u2019s how to change that](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-03-05/women-social-media-instagram-linkedin-toxic)\n\nSocial networks such as Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn can negatively affect women\u2019s lives offline too.\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nNarrower hate-speech policies may make sense to enable more debate on hot-button U.S. issues including the border and gender identity. But they will also end up loosening the spigot on ethnic vilification in parts of the world including Myanmar, South Sudan and Ethiopia, where such hatreds can explode into uncontrolled violence. Meta has not explained how the new global standards will apply in other jurisdictions, including not just repressive societies but also liberal democracies such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada that define and prohibit hateful speech more broadly than does the United States.\n\nAlthough the U.S. is rightly proud of its 1st Amendment tradition and wide berth for free speech, it should not force its standards on the world. And we can\u2019t rule out connections between [online hate speech](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-immigration-gender-policies-change/) and physical violence in the U.S. at a time when the link between online extremism and real-world terror may be [intensifying](https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/online-extremism-political-polarization-us-attacks-threat-rcna186017).\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement is likely to drive some Meta users off the platform. Those in the U.S. who aren\u2019t interested in seeing more hateful speech or politics can simply abandon their accounts and stay informed and connected to friends via other online alternatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the West Bank, Maldives, [some 30 countries in Africa](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/publication/access-granted-facebooks-free-basics-in-africa/), and elsewhere, Meta platforms essentially are the internet. In Africa, Meta invested in a program known as Free Basics to give users free online access through their phones, providing a lifeline \u2014 [though a controversial one](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets#:~:text=Free%20Basics%20is%20a%20Facebook,without%20paying%20for%20mobile%20data.) \u2014 for individuals and businesses that makes them dependent on the platform.\n\nMeta is not wrong to point out that the assertive policing of online speech is riddled with line-drawing exercises that are impossible to carry out at scale across billions of posts every day. Their choice to err on the side of more speech is a defensible, if imperfect, response to a political moment in the U.S. in which [a large segment of the population](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/04/29/americans-views-of-technology-companies-2/) feels constricted by the limits of acceptable public discourse.\n\nAround the world, though, users will have little say over how these changes play out in vastly different contexts, with consequences that may reshape societies and even threaten lives. America first, indeed.\n\n_Suzanne Nossel is a member of Facebook\u2019s Oversight Board and the author of \u201cDare to Speak: Defending Free Speech for All.\u201d_\n\n### More to Read\n\n- [![This photo illustration created on January 7, 2025, in Washington, DC, shows an image of Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, and an image of the Meta logo.

In fact, according to data from interviewing.io, a mock interview platform where candidates can practice for specific company interviews, the year-over-year increase of Meta interviews from January 2023 to January 2024 was 10X!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*diBzwPVYUUmQ0pMtmIud6g.png)\n\nHiring volume of FAANGs from [interviewing.io](https://interviewingio-metabase.herokuapp.com/public/dashboard/11313b19-b9fd-4532-9a3f-d2aad7e027c3)\n\nIf you look at the chart above showing hiring volume of different FAANG companies, you\u2019ll notice Meta has ramped up hiring in 2024, hiring significantly more engineers than other companies, and even holds a monopoly on engineering hiring. This uptick in hiring corresponds to Meta\u2019s strong 2023 economic performance and a jump in stock price from 2023 to 2024. With stock prices at all time highs, Meta is in a strong financial position to increase hiring. In this blog, I will explain how this current state of hiring affects interview candidates.\n\nIn September 2024, I finished and passed the Meta interview process for an IC4 software engineer. I was a recent candidate, and throughout my unique hiring process that lasted 9 months from January 2024 to September 2024, I have seen 2 waves of hiring at Meta. Although I am joining the company very soon, I will not pretend to have all the insider information on Meta\u2019s hiring practices\u2026\n\n## Create an account to read\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0story.\n\nThe\u00a0author made this story available to\u00a0Medium\u00a0members\u00a0only.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Medium, create a new account to read this story on us.\n\n[Continue in app](https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F485b9cc5b475&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderUser&%7Estage=regwall&source=-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------)\n\nOr, continue in mobile web\n\n[Sign up with Google](//medium.com/m/connect/google?state=google-%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Fchan-keith-96.medium.com%2F2024-meta-current-state-of-hiring-485b9cc5b475%3Fsource%3D-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------%26skipOnboarding%3D1%7Cregister&source=-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------)\n\n[Sign up with Facebook](//medium.com/m/connect/facebook?state=facebook-%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Fchan-keith-96.medium.com%2F2024-meta-current-state-of-hiring-485b9cc5b475%3Fsource%3D-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------%26skipOnboarding%3D1%7Cregister&source=-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------)\n\nSign up with email\n\nAlready have an account?

The year may be coming to a close, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve slowed down working on ways to help you find even more success next year.\n\nWe've introduced a variety of new updates designed to accelerate how you build, manage your apps and grow your audience. From short links that let you track impressions and conversions on nearly any platform, to brand new headset settings eliminating repetitive steps and more, keep reading to learn about updates you can use to achieve more in 2024.\n\nTrack and Measure Off-Platform Channels with Short Links\n\nWhen you\u2019re marketing your app, knowing which strategies are effective can save you time, energy, and money. With Short Links, we\u2019re giving you a brand new self-serve tool to track the source of traffic to your content and gain insights into which channels are driving engagement. This can help you adjust marketing strategy on-the-fly to maximize engagement and revenue.\n\n![](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/407627669_377647628105334_741284241856055413_n.png?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=mJYzKFMdAsgQ7kNvgF9LGwA&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&_nc_gid=A3FDL2wmDqVJTzhyC8p8Mvq&oh=00_AYCj0cQbEfLAnX8hvwse_knvb0OEGnc_hP7wAdgO2G0vow&oe=6799F163)\n\nShort Links can easily be created and managed from its new page in the Developer Dashboard, and you can instantly use them to share your app on social media, email, or any off-platform surface. Tracking the performance of your links is as easy as visiting the Short Links page, where you\u2019ll find clicks and impressions to various conversion goals, including app entitlements, IAP purchases, app launches, and app installs.\n\nTo get started with Short Links, please visit the [documentation](/horizon/resources/shortlinks/).\n\nChoose Builds for Specific Headsets with Device Targeting\n\nIt\u2019s important you have the flexibility to manage your apps across different Meta Quest devices. Headsets like Quest 3 and Quest Pro offer different advanced capabilities and apps using SDK v51 or higher are not supported on Quest 1. Starting today, you have the option to specify which devices your build supports either before uploading your build\u2014by setting the necessary parameters in your android manifest, upload CLI arguments or MQDH settings\u2014or after through the Developer Dashboard. A single build can target all Meta Quest devices or can specifically target Quest 1, Quest 2, Quest Pro, Quest 3, or future Quest devices.\n\n![](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/407602689_383546307436846_6348020946894162737_n.png?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=nLjcuTdZ9q8Q7kNvgGJw_zz&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&_nc_gid=A3FDL2wmDqVJTzhyC8p8Mvq&oh=00_AYAHaP3DqlO3zDbQN3a10NzkIM5IvFvscOGMFk99VwQ19Q&oe=6799C89B)\n\nThere are many scenarios Device Targeting makes easier:\n\n- Publishing a specific build for Quest 3 or Quest Pro\n- Discontinuing support for an app on Quest 1\n- Pushing hotfixes to a discontinued app on Quest 1\n- Having a main build for every other device\n\nOur new [documentation](/horizon/resources/publish-release-channels-device-targeting/) walks you through each of these scenarios so you know how to effectively leverage this feature to manage your content with greater precision and flexibility.\n\nSmoother Development with New Headset Settings\n\nWe\u2019ve added new, persistent developer settings to Meta Quest headsets that you can instantly access for a smoother development experience. To access these settings on your headset, go to **Settings > System > Developer** and toggle \u201cEnable Custom Settings\u201d on. If \u201cEnable Custom Settings\u201d is toggled off, then the new headset developer settings disappear and they revert back to their original values.\n\n![](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/408481483_702180145223011_3048801732345507987_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=ZmtF-_i8IdUQ7kNvgEU8Iqk&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&_nc_gid=A3FDL2wmDqVJTzhyC8p8Mvq&oh=00_AYA80-GffGWnA6sEp6f__xTpyF6pFMWd_KcYn4nb41Rwaw&oe=6799C3F2)\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the new headset settings:\n\n**MTP Notification**\n\nThis setting allows you to disable the \u201cUSB Detected\u201d notification from showing on your headset when it connects to a machine, removing an unnecessary notification and reducing confusion.\n\n**Boundary**\n\nThis setting allows you to disable the Boundary feature on your headset so that you can test your code changes without needing to set up or confirm any boundaries.\n\n**USB Link Auto-Connect**\n\nThis setting allows you to test your code changes faster by automatically starting a USB Link session when you plug in your headset to your PC running a Quest PC app. If you experience an unintentional disconnect from your USB Link session, this setting can also help you automatically reconnect back into USB Link.\n\nThis setting will now reconnect the session if it is disconnected due to one of the following reasons:\n\n- PC sleep\n- PC / HMD reboots\n\nIf you previously disabled system sleep or avoided certain activities with the intention of maintaining the USB Link session, please test out these new changes and let us know if you have any feedback.\n\nMeta Quest Pro Performance Boost for MR Experiences\n\nTo continue bringing improvements to our in-market products, we are rolling out a performance boost for Quest Pro MR profile later in December. We are delivering CPU improvements by 34% (from 1.38 GHz to 1.86 GHz, which is 10% more capacity than Quest 3 at Launch) and GPU improvements by 7% (from 490 MHz to 525 MHz) with a boost up to 19% if Dynamic Resolution ( [Unity](/horizon/documentation/unity/dynamic-resolution-unity/) \\| [Unreal](/horizon/documentation/unreal/dynamic-resolution-unreal/)) is turned on compared to launch. These improvements allow more flexibility and power for existing MR games and apps, as well as those in development. As a result, your users will have a smoother app experience. This should also simplify your development, aligning Quest Pro to the CPU and GPU improvements we previously made to Quest 2. See the below table of CPU and GPU frequencies.\n\n|  | **CPU** | **GPU** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Quest Pro MR** at launch | 1.38 GHz | 490 MHz |\n| **Quest 2 MR** after v55 | 1.86 GHz | 525MHz, up to 587 MHz with Dynamic Resolution |\n| **Quest Pro MR** profile after v60 | 1.86 GHz | 525MHz, up to 587 MHz with Dynamic Resolution |\n\nReduce Build Upload Time with Ovr-platform-util version 1.92\n\nEvery second you save adds up quickly over the course of an app development cycle. Now with Ovr-platform-util version 1.92, you can see a significant reduction in build upload time, with some titles like Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 getting a 2x improvement on average.\n\nThese optimizations work best for large uploads that contain multiple files, and all you need to do to enable them is update to the latest version of Meta Quest Developer Hub (MQDH) or you can run the following command to update to the latest version:\n\n`./ovr-platform-util self-update`\n\n2023 was a huge year for Meta Quest, and we\u2019re excited to see how you leverage these updates in 2024.

The company is starting to put increased focus on its augmented- and virtual reality products and services as part of its plan to build out the [metaverse](https://www.investopedia.com/metaverse-definition-5206578).1\n\nMeta competes with other companies that sell advertising to marketers, as well as companies that provide platforms for communicating and sharing content among users\u2019 various social networks. Major competitors include Apple ( [AAPL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL)), Alphabet ( [GOOGL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GOOGL)) Google and YouTube, Tencent Music Entertainment Group ( [TME](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=TME)), Amazon ( [AMZN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AMZN)), and X (formerly Twitter).1\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- Meta Platforms sells ads on social media websites and mobile applications and also sells augmented- and virtual-reality products and services.\n- Advertising sales are the primary source of Meta\u2019s revenue.\n- Facebook reported in 2021 that it lost daily active users for the first time in its history.\n- Reality Labs is Meta's augmented and virtual reality technologies segment, which features and sells products such as the Oculus VR headset.\n- Meta discloses data about the diversity and inclusion of its general management and employees.\n\n## How Does Meta Make Money?\n\nFacebook (the platform and apps) are free to users. So how does the company make any money at all? As noted above, its primary source of revenue is through [digital advertising](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050815/trends-and-growth-digital-advertising-industry.asp). Due to the enormous number of users and [social media](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-media.asp) reach, advertisers large and small consider Meta a prime opportunity to present ads to viewers. Meta provides various ways for them to advertise, such as self-serve and targeted ads.\n\nMarketers can target specific types of people based on different factors such as age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors. They buy ads that are placed on various Meta social media platforms and apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Ads also appear on affiliated [third-party](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/third-party.asp) applications and websites.\n\nAd prices are determined by an [auction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auction.asp) system based on bids and performance. Businesses are charged only for the number of clicks ads receive or the number of impressions (the number of times the ad is displayed).\n\nA business that wants to run an advertisement sets a maximum [budget](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp) and is charged a monthly billing based on the performance of the ad. While advertising provides Meta with the majority of its revenue, it's not the company's sole income focus. In fact, by changing its name from Facebook to Meta Platforms, Meta signaled its plan to develop sources of revenue beyond advertising. Its Reality Labs is one such source.\n\nFacebook changed its name to Meta on Oct. 28, 2021, and changed its ticker from FB META on June 9, 2022.2\n\n## Meta's Businesses\n\n### Facebook\n\n[Facebook](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/101315/biggest-risks-investing-facebook-stock.asp) is a social media platform that helps people to connect, communicate, and share with friends and family. It also facilitates connections with others with common interests. Facebook features such as Groups, Watch, and Marketplace can help users reach and make important new connections, as well. Facebook makes money for Meta primarily through advertising.\n\n### Instagram\n\n[Instagram](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102615/story-instagram-rise-1-photo0sharing-app.asp) is a social media application that individuals and companies use to share photos and videos with friends, followers, and other users around the world. As with Facebook, Meta makes money from the advertising placed on Instagram. It's appealing to advertisers because many users use the photo and video app to find and buy products.\n\n### Messenger and WhatsApp\n\n[Messenger](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-sending-money-facebook-works.asp) is the instant messaging application used by Facebook and Instagram to connect users to friends, family, groups, and businesses. It's required to direct message others on those platforms.\n\n[WhatsApp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032515/whatsapp-best-facebook-purchase-ever.asp)\u00a0is a hugely popular messaging application used by individuals and businesses worldwide. It's simple, secure, and free (except for potential cell phone data allowance fees). Companies use it to communicate on various subjects with customers.\n\nBoth apps present Meta with [monetization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetize.asp) opportunities such as advertising and charging businesses for premium features that enhance customer support.\n\n### Reality Labs\n\nMeta's Reality Labs develops and offers [Meta\u2019s augmented- and virtual reality](https://www.investopedia.com/metaverse-definition-5206578) hardware, software, and content. Augmented and virtual reality technologies are key to the company\u2019s plan of building out the virtual world called the metaverse.\n\nReality Labs makes the company\u2019s Oculus virtual-reality headsets for consumers and offers a marketplace where people can purchase apps and games to use on the Oculus headsets.3\n\nMeta Portal is another component that offers dedicated devices for video calling. These products support consumers' needs and desires to collaborate for business or simply to connect with friends and family.3\n\n## Meta\u2019s Financials\n\nMeta posted [net income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp) of $39 billion on [revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) of $134.9 billion for the 2023 fiscal year (FY) ending Dec. 31, 2023.4\n\nApproximately 99% of the year's total revenue was advertising revenue.The remaining revenue contributors were the company\u2019s Reality Labs segment and other sources.5\n\nRevenue grew 16% on a [year-over-year (YOY)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/year-over-year.asp) basis in 2023. Meta\u2019s total [operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp), which is used as a profit metric for its business segments, was $46.8 billion, which was up 61% when compared to the previous fiscal year.6\n\n## Meta\u2019s Business Segments' Financials\n\nAs of Q4 FY 2021, Meta started breaking down its financial results into the following two segments:\n\n- Family of Apps, which includes the company\u2019s main social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp\n- Other services\n- Reality Labs, which includes the company\u2019s augmented- and virtual-reality products and services\n\nBefore this change, the company only provided a breakdown of revenue for Advertising and Other revenue. It still provides this breakdown under the umbrella of the FoA segment.7\n\n### Family of Apps\n\nThis segment captures all of the revenue that Meta generates from selling advertising to [marketers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp), which comprises nearly all of the company\u2019s total revenue.8 As mentioned previously, ads are displayed on Meta\u2019s main social networking site, Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other third party affiliated websites or mobile applications.\n\nThe segment posted $133 billion in revenue in 2023, comprising over 98% of the company\u2019s total revenue. Revenue for the segment was up by approximately 16% compared with the year-ago revenue of $114 billion. [Operating income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp) came in at $62.9 billion, comprising all of the company\u2019s operating income for the quarter. Operating income grew 61% YOY.7\n\n### Reality Labs\n\nThe Reality Labs segment reported revenue of $1.9 billion in 2023, accounting for about 1.4% of the company's revenue. Revenue for the segment decreased by over 13% compared with the previous year.9\n\nThe segment reported an [operating loss](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-loss.asp) of $16 billion, thus reducing the company\u2019s overall operating income. The operating loss was significantly larger than the operating loss of $13.7 billion that the segment reported a year earlier.9\n\n## Meta\u2019s Recent Developments\n\nThe company reported a boost in the number of monthly active users, reaching three billion as of the end of December 2023. It also announced its first-ever cash dividend on Feb. 1, 2024.10\n\n### Regulatory Trouble Ahead?\n\nIn early 2023, Meta was fined $414 million by [European Union (EU)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp) regulators after it was discovered that the company had illegally forced users to accept personalized ads.11 The penalty carries significant implications for the social media giant's advertising businesses, Facebook and Instagram, in the EU, a key market.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc passed a landmark data privacy law in 2018 in order to limit the ability of Facebook and other companies to collect user data without consent. The law has now been found to have been violated by Facebook's lengthy terms of service, which effectively force users to either accept data collection or stop using the services. Facebook has three months to explain how it will comply with the ruling.\n\nAs a result of this and other potential regulatory rulings, Meta may need to make changes to its advertising practices in the EU and elsewhere. These changes could potentially involve giving users the option to choose whether their data is used for personalized advertising. Such changes, however, may negatively impact Meta's revenue, as it currently earns a significant portion of its revenue through targeted advertising based on user data.\n\n## How Does Meta Make Money From Ads?\n\nMeta, formerly known as Facebook, primarily earns revenues by selling advertising space on its social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. The cost of advertising varies and is based on an ad auction system. Marketers set a budget for advertising and Meta counters with how many impressions the company can get for their proposed budget.12 Meta also makes money by selling virtual-reality hardware and software as well as social media subscriptions. Although users can access Meta social media platforms at no cost, some may subscribe to exclusive features for a fee.\n\n## How Much Money Does Meta Make Per Day?\n\nMeta reported total revenues of $134.9 billion for the 2023 fiscal year, which equates to approximately $369 million earned per day ($134.9 billion/365 days).6\n\n## How Much Does Facebook Make Per User?\n\nMeta reported Facebook and Messenger's annual revenue per user (ARPU) as $13.12 in Dec. 2023. In other words, it earned an average of $13.12 per user during the year. The figure was higher in more developed markets; the company earned $68 per user in the United States and Canada, but in some other geographies the figure was as low as $4.50 per user. Also reported was Facebook's monthly active users (MAU), approximately three billion as of Dec. 31, 2023.13\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nMeta, the parent company to flagship brand and former namesake Facebook, reported 2023 revenues of $134 billion, with approximately 98% derived from advertising. The company reports revenues for its Family of Apps segment, which accounts for advertising dollars from its social media sites, plus the augmented and virtual reality Reality Labs segment, and other sources. Meta looks to Reality Labs to build out its virtual universe (the metaverse) and provide sources of income in addition to advertising.\n\nArticle Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Although the announcement [sent shares plunging](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-meta-q1-2024-earnings-.html) as much as 19% that evening, investors have come around to the company\u2019s costly AI ambitions. Meta\u2019s stock price hit a [record](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/alphabet-and-tesla-reach-fresh-records-joining-amazon-and-meta-.html) on Dec. 11, and it\u2019s up nearly 70% year to date as of the market\u2019s close on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there,\u201d [Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) said on a call with analysts in October.\n\nHe noted AI\u2019s \u201cpositive impact on nearly all aspects of our work,\u201d highlighting how the technology was key to rebuilding the company\u2019s online advertising business that took a lashing from [Apple](/quotes/AAPL/)\u2019s iOS privacy update in 2021. Additionally, he said AI underpins Meta\u2019s more nascent projects, such as its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and experimental [Orion augmented reality headset](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/meta-finally-finds-success-in-ar-vr-three-years-after-changing-name.html) that Zuckerberg believes could represent \u201cthe next computing platform.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s comments about AI underscore how the technology has become Meta\u2019s top priority, directly impacting the company\u2019s business and potentially paving the way for future revenue opportunities. Unlike the company\u2019s more conventional services, like Instagram and Facebook, AI is an infrastructure technology that Zuckerberg wants hardwired into its various products, particularly as competitors like OpenAI continue to make inroads with consumers.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s GPT family of AI models help power apps like ChatGPT, Meta\u2019s [family of Llama AI models](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/metas-open-source-approach-to-ai-puzzles-wall-street-techies-love-it.html) feeds the company\u2019s newer generative AI features like the Meta AI digital assistant. That chatbot represents Zuckerberg\u2019s primary way to introduce generative AI technologies to its billions of users.\n\n\u201cMeta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year,\u201d Zuckerberg said at Connect.\n\nThe company has been increasingly releasing new generative AI features for advertisers to continue improving the efficiency of its online advertising platform. And with the hiring last month of Clara Shih, who had been [Salesforce\u2019s](/quotes/CRM/) CEO of AI, to lead a new business AI group, Meta aims to build a more enterprise-focused unit in the new year.\n\n![The Meta AI logo is being displayed on a smartphone in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on June 10, 2024.

In April, the company brought it to the forefront of each of the apps in its empire by putting Meta AI in the search bars of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nBut because the company doesn\u2019t offer a stand-alone Meta AI app, it\u2019s difficult to directly compare its usage to similar services like ChatGPT or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, said David Curry, the data editor for insights firm Business of Apps.\n\nWhen it comes to monthly active users, the most popular of these generative AI chatbot apps is ChatGPT by a wide margin, followed by [Google](/quotes/GOOGL/) Gemini, [Microsoft](/quotes/MSFT/) Copilot, Claude and Perplexity, Curry said.\n\nThe Meta AI \u201cstandalone website gets less than 10 million views per month, putting it far below the major services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) and even lower than some mid-range players like Anthropic,\u201d Curry said, based on data he accessed via the Similarweb web-tracking service.\n\nMeta\u2019s finance chief, Susan Li, [told](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/META-Q2-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf) analysts in July that India has become the company\u2019s \u201clargest market for Meta AI usage.\u201d That usage has coincided with promising signs of [retention and engagement on WhatsApp](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/metas-whatsapp-is-chasing-big-businesses-to-capitalize-on-popularity.html), Li added.\n\n![Tourists are seen at the forecourt of the iconic Gateway of India as a digital display of messaging app WhatsApp is displayed, in Mumbai on August 25, 2023.

Ravan said he finds Meta AI, which he uses through WhatsApp, helpful for learning about the history of songs that he enjoys. He also uses it as a tool to learn about people in the music industry who he plans to work with or meet, describing it as great for preparation.\n\nSathish Thiyagarajan, 30, a technical support engineer for marketing tech firm GoX.AI, said he\u2019s increasingly using Meta AI as a search tool via WhatsApp, which he noted dominates the Indian market for mobile internet communications.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m talking with my family or my friends, if they\u2019re saying something to me and I have to search something, I\u2019m not going to go to Google,\u201d said Thiyagarajan, of Chennai, India. \u201cI\u2019m just going to put the phone in the speaker mode, and I\u2019ll immediately search through Meta AI.\u201d\n\nHowever, Thiyagarajan said he only uses Meta AI when he\u2019s on his phone. If he\u2019s at his computer, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is his preferred AI chatbot.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of Meta AI\u2019s bundling into WhatsApp\u2019s search functions.\n\nJawhar Sircar, 72 **,** a retired government official in Kolkata, India, called the Meta AI search feature in WhatsApp \u201cquite a nuisance.\u201d That\u2019s because whenever a user pauses while typing out a name in the search-find box, the Meta AI technology quickly \u201cpicks up whatever has been typed\u201d and generates what he describes as unnecessary search prompt suggestions.\n\nAs far as the popularity of Meta AI in India, Sircar said he thinks the feature is mostly used by companies, technologists and other professionals who \u201care getting hooked to AI\u201d alongside the Indian government\u2019s continued investment in regional computing infrastructure.\n\n\u201cProfessionals and companies have started using AI, but the general user has no need, at least not on the Meta platforms,\u201d Sircar wrote in an email.\n\n## Meta\u2019s AI strategy for advertisers\n\nAdvertising is still the key to revenue.\n\nMeta\u00a0[said](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/02/production-engineering/meta-andromeda-advantage-automation-next-gen-personalized-ads-retrieval-engine/)\u00a0in December that over 1 million advertisers had used the company\u2019s GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in a single month.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a +7% increase in conversions,\u201d Meta said at the time, regarding its image generation features.\n\nWhile people may [associate generative AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/08/how-the-generative-ai-boom-could-forever-change-online-advertising.html) with the visually striking and sometimes surreal imagery derived from popular services like Dall-E or Midjourney, it\u2019s more likely that the average small business advertiser uses Meta\u2019s GenAI tools for more subtle tasks, said Stacy Reed, an online advertising and Facebook ads consultant.\n\nThat includes using AI to create multiple versions of an ad\u2019s headline, auto-resizing the size of ads so they look appropriate within users\u2019 Instagram and Facebook apps, and repositioning certain images within the ads so that the promotions perform better, Reed said.\n\nAdvertisers that already write strong, creative copy can ask Meta\u2019s GenAI tools for \u201ca little bit more\u201d help, Reed said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you win with their AI tools,\u201d she said.\n\nReed said the many small advertisers she supports aren\u2019t associating the new features with AI.

Those services are more robust than Meta\u2019s built-in AI ad tools, he said.\n\nStill, the mere introduction of simple GenAI tools is beneficial to Metaconsidering it dominates the digital ads market along with Google. Meta\u2019s generative AI tools just have \u201cto be good enough to squeeze out more investment\u201d from advertisers, said Maurice Rahmey, CEO of performance marketing firm Disruptive Digital and a former Facebook customer manager.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better for their business, even if it\u2019s just those small, incremental changes,\u201d Rahmey said \u201cIt\u2019s a business of scale.\u201d\n\n![Clara Shih, Former CEO of Salesforce AI](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107142106-1666901089565-gettyimages-490159117-WIRED_BIZCON.jpeg?v=1734733934&w=1858&h=1045&vtcrop=y)\n\nClara Shih, Former CEO of Salesforce AI\n\nBloomberg \\| Bloomberg \\| Getty Images\n\n## What\u2019s next for Meta\u2019s enterprise play?\n\nWith Meta\u2019s hiring of Shih from Salesforce in November, some analysts say Meta could make an enterprise technology push with its [Llama family of open-source AI models](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/metas-open-source-approach-to-ai-puzzles-wall-street-techies-love-it.html).\n\nLlama\u2019s advancements \u201crepresent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers,\u201d Meta monetization head John Hegeman said in a statement.\n\nShih, who was one of [CNBC\u2019s 2024 changemakers](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/clara-shih-cnbc-changemakers.html), rejoined Salesforce in 2020 after previously working at the company from 2006 through 2009. As part of her most recent role at Salesforce, Shih helped oversee Einstein GPT for Service and Sales, a GenAI product intended for sales and customer support staff.\n\nDuring her first stint at Salesforce, Shih created a business app that let users connect their Salesforce customer relationship software with their Facebook connections. In 2009, she wrote \u201cThe Facebook Era,\u201d a book intended for professionals to better understand how to use social networks for business.\n\nMultiple former Meta AI and product leaders told CNBC that Shih\u2019s vast experience will be helpful considering the company has failed in previous attempts at building enterprise software.\n\nMeta [announced](https://www.facebook.com/help/1167689491269151/) in May that it plans to shut down Workplace, its business communications product, by 2026. And after buying enterprise startup Kustomer for about $1 billion in 2020, Meta spun it out in 2023 in a deal that was [reportedly](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-strikes-deal-to-divest-itself-of-kustomer-8e945431) valued at $250 million.\n\nThe most logical step for Meta would be to create a [larger business around WhatsApp](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/metas-whatsapp-is-chasing-big-businesses-to-capitalize-on-popularity.html), said Ralph Schackart, an internet equity analyst at investment bank William Blair. Specifically, WhatsApp could help businesses build customer-service chatbots using Meta\u2019s GenAI, Schackart said.\n\n\u201cLonger term, this is going to evolve into customized sales agents, which is a $3 trillion-plus industry,\u201d Schackart said about Meta\u2019s WhatsApp business AI chatbot opportunity.\n\n**WATCH**: [If the U.S. bans TikTok, China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/12/06/if-the-u-s-bans-tiktok-china-could-retaliate-and-target-tesla-and-apple-deepwaters-gene-munster.html).\n\n![If the U.S. bans TikTok China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple: Deepwater's Gene Munster](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108072817-17335249551733524950-37440314808-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1733524953&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:2304:23\n\nIf the U.S. bans TikTok China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple: Deepwater\u2019s Gene Munster\n\n[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fastmoney/)\n\n[iframe](https://sp.auth.adobe.com/entitlement/v4/AccessEnablerProxy.html?a4f31600ce9c60894320#https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F12%2F23%2Fmeta-went-all-in-on-ai-in-2024-the-pressure-builds-in-2025.html)\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfnMFMeAAAAABvWy2u0ZzAqPaVUflZOPibgK-u5&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=zIriijn3uj5Vpknvt_LnfNbF&size=invisible&cb=1qedfbydiu67)",

shadow\n\n[Article](https://www.emarketer.com/articles) by **[Daniel Konstantinovic](https://www.emarketer.com/analysts/daniel-konstantinovic)**\u00a0\u00a0\\|\u00a0\u00a0Oct 31, 2024\n\nShare\n\nTopics\n\n[Social Media Users](https://www.emarketer.com/topics/topic/social-media-users)\n\n[Social Media Usage](https://www.emarketer.com/topics/topic/social-media-usage)\n\n[Social Media Marketing](https://www.emarketer.com/topics/topic/social-media-marketing)\n\n[United States](https://www.emarketer.com/search/?query=united%20states)\n\n**The news: Meta** reported a strong Q3 with revenues beating expectations and landing just shy of 20% growth. While the gains emphasize its continued leadership in the social media market, lower-than-expected user growth could foreshadow challenges.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n\n- Revenues were $40.6 billion, up 19% year over year and above expectations of $40.29 billion.\n- Family daily active people grew 5% YoY to 3.29 billion, falling below expectations.\n- Costs and expenses grew 14% YoY, including wider losses for metaverse segment **Reality Labs**. Headcount was up 9%, bringing its total to 72,404.\n\n**Despite significant revenue gains, Meta shares were down 10% in pre-market trading**, a sign that investors are anxious about slow user growth and rising business investments.\n\nThe streak of revenue gains overlaps with a nearly two-year long cost-cutting effort that has seen the company [lay off tens of thousands of employees](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/meta-s--year-of-efficiency--shifts-permanent-strategy-layoffs--restructuring-persist?_gl=1*xuv0wu*_gcl_au*MTQ3OTU2Mjg1Mi4xNzI0NzY3MTgzLjIzOTczNjExMC4xNzMwMzEwMDQxLjE3MzAzMTAyMDQ.*_ga*MTcwOTkwNDkzNi4xNjk5Mzc1OTg1*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*MTczMDMwOTYxOS44MjkuMS4xNzMwMzEwMjIxLjM5LjAuMA..&_ga=2.28754174.372069724.1730124101-1709904936.1699375985). Meta dubbed 2023 its \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d but the effort has spilled over well into 2024; the company went through another round of layoffs earlier this month.\n\n**Why this matters:** As a leading force in social media and one half of the digital ad duopoly, Meta\u2019s earnings can indicate the health of digital advertising. Its lower-than-expected user growth falls in line with our own forecasting, which shows that time spent with media is declining from 2023 highs.\n\n- Meta will have difficulty increasing time spent on its platforms. Our [Global Media Intelligence Report](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/global-media-intelligence-report-2024) found that **time spent with all media will decline this year from 2023 peaks** (mobile time spent will remain flat), a stark reminder that there\u2019s only so much room for the metric to grow.\n- Still, Meta remains far ahead of other social media competitors. **Snap** and **[Reddit](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/reddit-q3-earnings-soar-with-ad-revenue-growth--profits-hit-record)** posted strong earnings earlier this week, but with Q3 revenues of $1.37 billion and $348.4 million, respectively, a vast gap remains between them and Meta\u2019s position.\n- [Meta is reportedly working on an AI-powered search tool](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/meta-s-ai-search-strategy-could-reshape-search-advertising-ecosystems) for **Instagram,** **Facebook**, and **WhatsApp** users to answer queries in-app rather than ceding traffic to **Google** and **Bing**, per The Information. That effort could address investor concerns about user growth.\n\n**Our take:** Meta dominates social media, and its Q3 results show the company isn\u2019t wavering. Smaller rivals are managing to make progress, but Meta\u2019s lead is nearly insurmountable.\n\n- Competition for consumers\u2019 attention is at a peak, and Meta will have to show that it can meaningfully increase revenues in the future even if user growth starts to lag.\n\nshare via email\n\n[Share via Email](mailto:?subject=Meta revenues surge in Q3, but slow user growth casts a shadow&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emarketer.com%2Fcontent%2Fmeta-revenues-surge-q3-slow-user-growth-casts-shadow \"Share via Email\")\n\n[Share via Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emarketer.com%2Fcontent%2Fmeta-revenues-surge-q3-slow-user-growth-casts-shadow \"Share via Facebook\")\n\nWant more marketing insights?\n\nSign up for EMARKETER Daily, our free newsletter.\n\nCalifornia Resident\n\nI agree to the terms of service and privacy policy.\n\nBy clicking \u201cSign Up\u201d, you agree to receive emails from EMARKETER (e.g. FYIs, partner content, webinars, and other offers) and accept our [Terms of Service](https://www.emarketer.com/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.emarketer.com/privacy/).

Explore how Meta is positioning itself for future growth while addressing key challenges.\n\n![Facebook (Meta) SWOT Analysis: Comprehensive Insights for 2024](/content/images/size/w30/2024/10/Meta-s-SWOT-Analysis-Zuckerberg-s-Future-Vision.png)A visualization of the interconnected digital future, showcasing the potential of social media, e-commerce, and emerging technologies in shaping online interactions and experiences.\n\nGiroAI Script Summary\n\nIn the ever-changing landscape of social media and technology, Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook, continues to be a dominant force. This comprehensive SWOT analysis delves into the internal strengths and weaknesses of the company, as well as the external opportunities and threats it faces. By examining these internal and external factors, we can gain valuable insights into Meta's current position and future prospects in the realm of social networking and beyond.\n\n### From College Network to Global Tech Giant\n\nFacebook's journey from a college networking site to a global tech giant is nothing short of remarkable. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and his fellow Harvard students, the platform has grown to become an integral part of daily life for billions of people worldwide. As of 2024, Facebook remains one of the largest social media platforms, despite facing increasing competition and scrutiny.\n\nThe company's expansion beyond its core social networking service has been significant. With acquisitions like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, Facebook has diversified its portfolio and rebranded itself as Meta Platforms. This shift reflects the company's ambition to shape the future of digital interaction, e-commerce, and virtual reality experiences.\n\n## Strengths: The Pillars of Meta's Success\n\n### Unparalleled User Base and Network Effects\n\nMeta's most formidable strength lies in its massive user base. With over 3 billion active monthly users across its family of apps, the platform benefits from powerful network effects. This vast user base not only provides a rich source of data but also makes Facebook an essential platform for advertisers and businesses.\n\nFacebook's user base is not just large; it's also highly engaged. The platform's ability to keep users interact with content, friends, and businesses for extended periods is a key factor in its success. This high level of user engagement translates directly into advertising revenue and opportunities for e-commerce integration.\n\n### Robust Advertising Platform\n\nFacebook's advertising platform is a cornerstone of its business model. The company's ability to offer highly targeted advertising based on user data and online behavior has made it a go-to platform for businesses of all sizes. Facebook's social media advertising capabilities are unmatched, allowing advertisers to reach specific demographics with precision.\n\nThe effectiveness of this platform is evident in the company's financial performance. Meta Platforms consistently generates substantial advertising income, which forms the backbone of its revenue generation model. This robust advertising ecosystem not only generates substantial revenue but also creates a strong moat against competition from other social media companies.\n\n### Technological Innovation and Infrastructure\n\nMeta's commitment to technological innovation is another key strength. The company invests heavily in research and development, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality. This focus on innovation helps Meta stay ahead of technological trends and create new revenue streams.\n\nThe company's efforts in virtual reality, particularly through its Oculus brand, position it as a leader in the emerging field of immersive technologies. As consumer electronics trends shift towards more immersive experiences, Meta's early investments in this area could pay significant dividends.\n\n### Strong Brand Recognition and Global Presence\n\nDespite rebranding to Meta, Facebook boasts incredibly strong brand recognition worldwide. The Facebook name is synonymous with social networking for many users, especially in markets where it was one of the first social media platforms to gain widespread adoption.\n\nThis brand strength extends to Meta's other properties as well. Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are all powerful brands in their own right, each with hundreds of millions of active users. This diverse range of popular apps gives Meta a significant advantage in maintaining its user base and attracting new users across different demographics.\n\n## Weaknesses: Challenges Meta Must Address\n\n### Privacy Concerns and Data Security Issues\n\nOne of Meta's most significant weaknesses is its ongoing struggle with privacy concerns and data security issues. The company has faced numerous controversies and regulatory challenges related to its handling of user data. These issues have damaged public trust and led to increased scrutiny from governments worldwide.\n\nData breaches and concerns about how user data is shared with third parties have been particularly damaging to Facebook's reputation. The company has had to invest heavily in improving its security measures and transparency, but rebuilding trust remains a significant challenge.\n\n### Dependence on Advertising Revenue\n\nDespite its success, Meta's heavy reliance on advertising revenue is a potential weakness. The company's business model is vulnerable to shifts in advertising trends, particularly during economic downturns. This dependence also makes Meta susceptible to changes in privacy regulations that could impact its ability to collect and use user data for targeted advertising.\n\nThe rise of ad blocking technology presents another challenge to Meta's advertising-dependent model. As more users adopt tools to block or limit online advertising, the company may need to explore alternative revenue streams or develop new ways to deliver ads that are less intrusive and more valuable to users.\n\n### Content Moderation Challenges\n\nMeta's role as a platform for user-generated content presents ongoing challenges in content moderation. The company must balance free expression with the need to combat misinformation, hate speech, and fake news. This balancing act is complex and resource-intensive, often leading to controversies regardless of the decisions made.\n\nThe spread of fake news and misinformation on Facebook has been a particularly thorny issue, with potential ramifications for political processes and public discourse. Addressing these concerns without being seen as overly censorious is a delicate task that requires ongoing attention and refinement of policies and technologies.\n\n### Declining Engagement Among Younger Users\n\nWhile Meta's platforms, particularly Facebook, remain popular among a broad range of demographics, there are signs of declining engagement among younger users. This demographic is increasingly drawn to other social media platforms that offer different features or a perceived \"cooler\" image.\n\nThe challenge of attracting and retaining younger users is crucial for Meta's long-term success. As the company's core user base ages, it needs to ensure that it remains relevant and attractive to new generations of social media users.\n\n## Opportunities: Avenues for Growth and Expansion\n\n### Metaverse Development\n\nThe company's rebrand to Meta signifies its big bet on the metaverse, a concept of interconnected virtual experiences. This represents a significant opportunity for Meta to shape the future of digital interaction and potentially create new revenue streams beyond advertising.\n\nBy leveraging its strengths in social networking, virtual reality (through Oculus), and its massive user base, Meta is well-positioned to be a leader in this emerging space. The metaverse could open up new opportunities for e-commerce, entertainment, and social interaction that go far beyond traditional social media platforms.\n\n### Expansion in E-commerce\n\nMeta's large user base and engaged communities provide a strong foundation for expanding its e-commerce capabilities. The company has been investing in features like Facebook Marketplace and Instagram Shopping, aiming to create seamless shopping experiences within its platforms.\n\nThe integration of e-commerce features into its social networking platforms could transform Meta into a major player in online retail. By enabling users to discover, share, and purchase products without leaving its ecosystem, Meta could capture a significant share of the growing e-commerce market.\n\n### Advancements in AI and Machine Learning\n\nMeta's ongoing investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning present opportunities to enhance user experiences, improve ad targeting, and develop new products and services. These technologies could help Meta maintain its competitive edge and open up new avenues for growth.\n\nAI-driven improvements in content recommendations, ad targeting, and user experience could lead to increased user engagement and more effective advertising. Additionally, AI could play a crucial role in addressing some of Meta's weaknesses, such as improving content moderation and enhancing privacy protections.\n\n### Expansion of Messaging Services\n\nWith the success of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, Meta has a significant opportunity to expand its messaging services. As communication increasingly shifts to digital platforms, Meta could leverage its existing user base to introduce new features or even monetize these services more effectively.\n\nPotential areas for expansion include integrating more business tools into messaging platforms, facilitating peer-to-peer marketplace transactions, or introducing additional paid services for power users or businesses.\n\n## Threats: External Challenges to Meta's Dominance\n\n### Increasing Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nMeta faces growing regulatory pressure worldwide. Governments and regulatory bodies are increasingly concerned about the company's market power, data practices, and impact on society. This scrutiny could lead to new regulations that limit Meta's operations or force significant changes to its business model.\n\nPotential regulatory challenges include stricter privacy laws, antitrust measures that could force Facebook to divest some of its acquisitions, and new digital tax regimes that could impact the company's profitability in certain markets.\n\n### Fierce Competition in the Tech Industry\n\nWhile Meta remains a dominant player, it faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging platforms. Companies like TikTok have successfully captured younger demographics, while Google and Amazon compete fiercely for digital advertising dollars.\n\nThe rapidly evolving nature of social media means that new competitors can quickly gain traction, especially among younger users. Meta must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its position as a leader in social networking and digital advertising.\n\n### Technological Disruptions\n\nThe rapid pace of technological change presents both opportunities and threats for Meta. Emerging technologies could disrupt Meta's current business model or give rise to new competitors. Staying ahead of these changes requires constant innovation and adaptation.\n\nPotential disruptive technologies include new forms of online video streaming, advancements in augmented reality that could compete with Meta's virtual reality offerings, or novel social platforms that offer unique features or experiences.\n\n### Changing User Preferences and Behaviors\n\nUser preferences and behaviors in social media are constantly evolving. Trends such as increased concern for privacy, a shift towards more private or ephemeral forms of sharing, or changes in how users interact with content could pose challenges to Meta's existing models.\n\nFor example, if users become more resistant to sharing personal information or engaging with ads, it could undermine the effectiveness of Meta's advertising platform and force the company to rethink its approach to user data and targeted advertising.\n\n## Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Social Media and Technology\n\nThis SWOT analysis of Facebook, now Meta Platforms, reveals a company with significant strengths, including its unparalleled user base, robust advertising platform, and commitment to technological innovation. These assets provide a strong foundation for future growth and expansion into new areas like the metaverse and e-commerce.\n\nHowever, the company also faces substantial challenges. Privacy concerns, dependence on advertising revenue, and content moderation issues remain significant weaknesses that require ongoing attention and investment. Additionally, increasing regulatory scrutiny, fierce competition, and the threat of technological disruptions pose external challenges to Meta's dominance.\n\nAs Meta continues to evolve, its success will depend on its ability to leverage its strengths, address its weaknesses, capitalize on emerging opportunities, and mitigate potential threats. The company's focus on long-term technological trends, particularly in AI and virtual reality, demonstrates a forward-thinking approach. However, rebuilding trust with users and navigating the complex regulatory landscape will be crucial for sustaining its position as a leader in the tech industry.\n\nThe coming years will be pivotal for Meta as it seeks to transform itself and shape the future of digital interaction. By maintaining its innovative spirit while addressing its challenges head-on, Meta has the potential to continue its remarkable journey and remain a dominant force in the ever-evolving digital landscape.\n\n## FAQs: Understanding Meta's SWOT Analysis\n\n### **What is the organizational analysis of Facebook (Meta)?**\n\nThe organizational analysis of Meta, formerly Facebook, involves examining its internal structure, culture, and processes.

Since it started in 2004, Meta has grown from a simple social networking site into a huge ecosystem that includes social media, virtual reality, and more. Central to this transformation is the innovative Facebook business model, which earns substantial revenue through a wide range of products and services.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll explore the details of Facebook business model, looking at how it uses user data, targeted advertising, and technological advancements to stay at the top of the digital world. Join us as we uncover the key elements that drive one of the most influential companies in the tech industry.\n\n## From College Dorm to Global Phenomenon: Facebook\u2019s Rise\n\n**Founding and Early Years:** In February 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched \u201cThefacebook\u201d from his dorm room at Harvard University. The platform quickly gained popularity among Harvard students and soon expanded to other universities. By the end of 2004, Facebook had over [1 million registered users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook). In 2005, the platform dropped \u201cThe\u201d from its name and opened registration to high school networks, work networks, and eventually, everyone over age 13 with a valid email address.\n\n**Key Features and Innovations:** Over the years, Facebook has introduced numerous features and innovations that have transformed the way we use social media. In 2006, the company launched the News Feed. In 2007, the Like button was introduced, enabling users to express their approval of content with a single click. Facebook has also made strategic acquisitions, such as Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion, expanding its reach and capabilities.\n\n**Monetization Strategies:** In 2007, Facebook launched its advertising platform, allowing businesses to target users based on their interests, location, and demographics. Over time, Facebook has refined its advertising strategies, introducing sponsored posts, video ads, and carousel ads. In 2018, Facebook generated $55.8 billion in revenue, with over 98% coming from advertising.\n\n**Controversies and Challenges:** Despite its success, Facebook has faced numerous controversies and challenges throughout its history. In 2011, the company settled with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep its privacy promises. In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal erupted, revealing that the political consulting firm had improperly accessed the data of millions of Facebook users. Facebook has also faced criticism for its role in the spread of misinformation and hate speech on its platform.\n\n**Global Impact:** Facebook has had a profound impact on the way we communicate and interact with each other globally. The platform has enabled people to connect with friends, family, and communities across borders and time zones. Facebook has also played a significant role in shaping political discourse, with world leaders and activists using the platform to share their messages and mobilize supporters. Additionally, Facebook has transformed the way businesses market and sell their products, with many small and medium-sized enterprises relying on the platform to reach new customers.\n\n**Future Outlook:** As Facebook looks to the future, the company faces both challenges and opportunities. The platform will need to continue to innovate and adapt to changing user preferences and technological advancements. Facebook will also need to address ongoing concerns about privacy, misinformation, and the impact of social media on mental health. However, with its vast user base, deep pockets, and ambitious vision, Facebook is well-positioned to remain a dominant force in the social media landscape for years to come.\n\n## Key Statistics:\n\n- By January 2024, Facebook had [3.06 billion](https://www.statista.com/topics/751/facebook/#editorsPicks) monthly active users.\n- [89%](https://www.statista.com/topics/751/facebook/#editorsPicks) of worldwide marketers are on Facebook.\n- Meta\u2019s global revenue for the year is [$134 billion](https://www.statista.com/topics/751/facebook/#editorsPicks).\n- Facebook\u2019s average revenue per user is [$13.12.](https://www.statista.com/topics/751/facebook/#editorsPicks)\n\n## ![Facebook Revenue Graph](https://oyelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Facebook-Revenue-Graph.png)\n\n## Facebook Business Model\n\nFacebook boasts over 3.06 billion monthly active users, making it the largest social network worldwide. This vast user base has enabled Facebook to generate substantial revenue through various channels, primarily advertising. In this blog post, we will explore the different revenue sources that contribute to Facebook\u2019s financial success.\n\n### ![Facebook busiess model overview](https://oyelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Facebook-busiess-model-overview.png)\n\n### Advertising Revenue: The Backbone of The Facebook Business Model\n\nAdvertising revenue is the cornerstone of Facebook\u2019s business model, accounting for over 97% of its total revenue in 2022. The platform offers a wide range of advertising formats, including News Feed ads, Stories ads, and sponsored posts. Facebook\u2019s targeted advertising approach, which leverages user data to deliver personalized ads, has proven to be highly effective in attracting advertisers and generating revenue.\n\nIn 2022, Facebook generated an average revenue of $13.54 per user, with North America being the highest-earning region at $53.77 per user. The platform\u2019s ability to provide advertisers with precise targeting capabilities and measurable results has made it an attractive choice for businesses of all sizes.\n\n### Data Monetization: Leveraging User Information for Revenue Generation\n\nFacebook\u2019s ability to collect and analyze user data has been a significant factor in its revenue generation. The platform gathers information about user interests, demographics, and online behavior, which it then uses to deliver targeted ads. While this practice has raised concerns about user privacy, it has also proven to be a lucrative revenue stream for Facebook.\n\nIn 2021, Facebook faced a major data breach that exposed the personal information of over 530 million users. This incident highlighted the importance of data security and the potential risks associated with data monetization. However, Facebook has continued to emphasize the value of targeted advertising and the benefits it provides to both users and advertisers.\n\n### Acquisitions and Revenue Diversification: Instagram and WhatsApp\n\nFacebook\u2019s acquisition strategy has played a crucial role in diversifying its revenue streams. The company\u2019s purchase of Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion has proven to be a highly successful investment. As of 2023, Instagram boasts over 1 billion monthly active users and has become a significant contributor to Facebook\u2019s advertising revenue.\n\nSimilarly, Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion has expanded its user base and provided opportunities for revenue diversification. While WhatsApp has not yet fully monetized its platform, the company has been exploring ways to generate revenue through features like WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Pay.\n\n### Emerging Revenue Streams: Exploring New Avenues for Growth\n\nAs Facebook continues to evolve, the company has been exploring new revenue streams to reduce its reliance on advertising. One such initiative is Facebook Shops, which allows businesses to create online stores within the Facebook and Instagram platforms. This feature has the potential to generate revenue through transaction fees or commissions on sales.\n\nAnother emerging revenue stream for Facebook is its foray into e-commerce. The company has been investing in tools and features that enable businesses to sell products directly on its platforms. This includes the introduction of Facebook Marketplace, which allows users to buy and sell items locally.\n\n### Challenges and Opportunities: The Road Ahead\n\nWhile the Facebook business model has been successful, the company faces several challenges that could impact its future growth. Regulatory scrutiny, particularly around data privacy and antitrust concerns, has been a significant issue for Facebook. The company has faced fines and legal battles in various countries, which could potentially impact its revenue generation.\n\nHowever, Facebook also has significant opportunities for growth. As the world becomes increasingly digital, the demand for targeted advertising and e-commerce solutions is likely to continue increasing. Facebook\u2019s vast user base and extensive data collection capabilities position it well to capitalize on these trends.\n\n**Also Read:** [The Ingenious Twitter Business Model \u2013 Insights for Your Success](https://oyelabs.com/twitter-business-model/)\n\n## Cost Breakdown for Developing a Social Media App like Facebook\n\nCreating a social media app similar to Facebook involves a thorough cost analysis.

Despite facing challenges, Facebook continues to innovate and connect billions of users worldwide. As we navigate the complexities of data privacy and user engagement, it\u2019s essential for Facebook to balance revenue generation with user trust and satisfaction.

From its peak of $384 in 2021 to its low of $88 in 2022, the stock price plummeted by as much as 77%. However, in 2024, the share price had once rebounded to $540, hitting a 5x peak from its lowest point. With such a rollercoaster ride, Meta's stock performance has undoubtedly kept investors on edge.\n\n![[October.2024] A Peek into Meta's Earnings: Cyclical Advertising Revenue and Loss Changes in Metaverse -1](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17301697531393253055634-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\n\nMeta's recent stock price rebound may be attributed to various factors, including some breakthroughs in its earnings performance. In late 2021, Facebook announced its name change to Meta and made significant investments in the metaverse. However, the company's performance has been lackluster for several consecutive quarters, which was partly reflected in plummeting share prices during the same period.\n\nMeta's highly elastic stock price has brought its financial reports into the spotlight as well. Each earnings release may signal a potential investment opportunity, but before diving in, investors need to understand how to interpret their financial statements.\n\n[![banner-img](https://foss-mm-us.moomoo.com/optimus_oss_fe/prod/1733281831023-options_trading_overall_benefits_learn.png)](https://www.moomoo.com/us/invest/options)\n\nHow should we interpret Meta's earnings reports? Is its reversed performance sustainable? To help answer these questions, we may focus on several key indicators from Meta's recent earnings report, including user traffic, advertising revenue, and losses in Meta's metaverse business.\n\n## 1\\. User Traffic\n\nUser traffic is the backbone of social ecosystems like Meta, and growth in this area drives revenue growth. Meta owns social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, with Facebook being the cornerstone. To properly gauge changes in user traffic, we may examine user scale, engagement, and value from similar products.\n\nIn terms of user scale, Meta has had an impressive year. In Q4 of 2023, monthly active users(MAU) across all platforms reached 3.98 billion, up 20 million from the previous quarter. Daily active users(DAU) also hit a record high of 3.19 billion, up 50 million from the previous quarter.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Meta's daily active users reached 3.24 billion, an increase of 50 million from the previous quarter. This continuous growth on a large basis may send a positive signal. However, the company did not disclose MAU data this quarter.\n\n![[October.2024] A Peek into Meta's Earnings: Cyclical Advertising Revenue and Loss Changes in Metaverse -2](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17301697529458080083585-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\n\nWhen measuring user engagement, we primarily examine the proportion of daily active users in relation to monthly active users. This ratio has remained relatively high and stable at nearly 80%.\n\nFrom a user value perspective, the key metric to watch is Average Revenue per Person (ARPP). Since Q3 2022, Meta's ARPP has consistently increased for eight quarters, with each quarter showing growth of over 10%, indicating a rapid and sustained improvement in user value.\n\nOverall, Meta's user traffic foundation seems to be relatively stable. In the upcoming financial reports, we can continue monitoring whether Meta can strengthen its user base.\n\n## 2\\. Advertising Revenue\n\nThanks to its vast user traffic, advertising has become Meta's primary source of revenue, accounting for over 98% of its total revenue. From this perspective, Meta is perhaps the most ad-centric among tech giants. Despite its decisive move to enter the metaverse business through a name change, the market remains most interested in its advertising business.\n\nMeta's performance has been volatile in recent quarters, experiencing a reversal from decline to growth. In terms of revenue, its advertising business has been the primary driver behind this reversal.\n\n![[October.2024] A Peek into Meta's Earnings: Cyclical Advertising Revenue and Loss Changes in Metaverse -3](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17301697531846244935869-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\n\nThere may be two key factors to consider to assess the growth of Meta's advertising business.\n\nFirstly, the economic cycle. While Meta is a tech company, its advertising business has strong cyclical attributes and is closely tied to the economy. From mid-2022, as the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates, advertisers lowered their expectations for economic growth and market demand. This resulted in reduced ad spending and put pressure on Meta's growth. As a result, Meta's revenue declined year-on-year\uff08YoY\uff09 from Q3 2022 onwards.\n\nHowever, since 2023, advertisers may have found that the actual economic situation is better than their estimate. Since 2023, advertisers have found the economic situation to be much better than their previously pessimistic expectations, leading to an increase in ad spending. This has helped Meta return to growth.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Meta's ad revenue grew by 21.7% year-over-year. While this growth rate has slowed compared to the previous quarter, it remains above 20%. Currently, market expectations for U.S. GDP growth remain strong, suggesting that Meta may continue to experience a period of favorable conditions.\n\nSecondly, we may examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on advertising. During the earnings call, the Meta management highlighted that AI-driven content recommendations are growing the fastest among Facebook subscriptions. Additionally, the company launched the automated advertising product Meta Advantage, with almost all Meta advertisers using at least one AI-driven product.\n\nAI may optimize the efficiency of content promotion and increase the conversion rate of advertising. However, neither of these effects may be immediately apparent. Consequently, we should take a long-term perspective when considering the impact of AI on Meta's advertising business.\n\n## 3\\. Loss on the Metaverse Business\n\nTo reduce its reliance on advertising, Google developed its cloud business, while Meta placed a high-stakes bet on the metaverse. However, unlike Google's cloud business, the road to the metaverse has been bumpy for Meta.\n\nThis is mainly because the metaverse is still in its nascent stage, and content and commercial ecosystems have yet to be established. Most users who are willing to pay for it are early adopters, and mass adoption may still be a long way off. As a result, Meta's Reality Labs, which serves as its testing ground for metaverse business, generates low revenue with high initial capital expenditures and operating losses. This drags Meta's profit and cash flow.\n\nLooking at the losses more closely, Reality Labs' revenue generally only amounts to a few hundred million dollars per quarter and is relatively unstable. However, operating losses amount to several billion dollars, reaching $4.65 billion in Q4 2023. In Q2 2024, Reality Labs' revenue declined to $350 million, with over $4 billion losses.\n\n![[October.2024] A Peek into Meta's Earnings: Cyclical Advertising Revenue and Loss Changes in Metaverse -4](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17301697534872924485079-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\n\nFrom the perspective of free cash flow, Reality Labs' high research and development expenses and capital expenditures have a significant negative impact on Meta's cash flow. As we can see from data on moomoo, Meta's quarterly free cash flow dropped from over $10 billion to less than $500 million, partly due to these factors.\n\nIn recent conference calls, the company revealed that it is cutting its investment budget for virtual reality, which indicates a shift in its focus. Additionally, for the recent quarters, the operating losses of Reality Labs have shown signs of narrowing. Although there was a notable rebound in losses in Q4 2023, the robust growth of the advertising business has led to a significant overall recovery in free cash flow, maintaining over $11 billion for five consecutive quarters.\n\n![[October.2024] A Peek into Meta's Earnings: Cyclical Advertising Revenue and Loss Changes in Metaverse -5](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17301697543345540134447-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\n\nHowever, while from the perspective of meta management, the metaverse business may have a promising future in the long term, there is still a great deal of uncertainty, and the market may be unwilling to pay for a distant vision. Instead, the market may be more concerned about the losses generated by this business. Therefore, in the coming quarters, we should pay close attention to the losses incurred by the metaverse business. It is important to avoid a situation where the losses expand and once again impact the overall profit margin and cash flow of the company.\n\nHaving read this far, you may now have a deeper understanding of how to interpret Meta's financial reports. It's noteworthy that the release of earnings reports from prominent companies may present unique trading opportunities for different types of investors.\n\nFor instance, if an investor, after analyzing past reports and considering recent developments, believes a company's latest earnings will send positive signals and boost the short-term stock price, they might consider taking a long position. This could involve buying the underlying stock or purchasing call [options](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-what-are-options-117111-240394347).\n\nConversely, if the investor expects the earnings to be unfavorable and potentially pressure the stock price, they might consider taking a short position, either through short selling or buying put options.\n\nIf the report's outcome is unclear but volatility is expected, they might use a straddle strategy, buying both calls and puts.\n\nHowever, investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance, particularly when considering high-risk trades like short selling or options, before making any trading decisions.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are several key factors to consider when evaluating Meta's performance.\n\nFirstly, user traffic is the foundation of Meta's business. We should monitor its user base, user engagement, and competitive landscape.\n\nSecondly, advertising is the main source of revenue for Meta. Therefore, we should consider paying attention to changes in the economic cycle and the impact of AI on enhancing Meta's advertising business.\n\nFinally, the metaverse business may be Meta's new growth point in the distant future, but it currently operates at a significant loss. As such, we should be vigilant about the possibility of expanding losses.\n\nEach earnings report may present new investment opportunities, so investors should align their strategies with their risk capacity.\n\n![[October.2024] A Peek into Meta's Earnings: Cyclical Advertising Revenue and Loss Changes in Metaverse -6](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com/17301697536567893961837-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\n\nDisclaimer: This content is for informational and educational purposes only and does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement of any specific investment or investment strategy.\n\nRead more\n\n\nRecommended\n\n- [![recommend-img](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com/20230928000044038fa0ad5a0e3.png?imageMogr2/rquality/85/thumbnail/258x/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\\\\\n\\\\\nTechnical Analysis of Trend Trading\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nViews 16K](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-introduction-to-technical-analysis-102718-230504096)\n\n- [![recommend-img](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com/1724740743039.png?imageMogr2/rquality/85/thumbnail/258x/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to Allocate Assets During the Election?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nViews 9327](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-understanding-the-u-s-election-and-its-impact-on-investments-117406-240918046)\n\n- [![recommend-img](https://courseimg.futunn.com/202209080000276030207dd687c.png?imageMogr2/rquality/85/thumbnail/258x/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\\\\\n\\\\\nInvest in Stocks: Quickstart Guide\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nViews 460K](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-how-to-build-your-wealth-40731-2111650172)\n\n- [![recommend-img](https://courseimg.futunn.com/2022090100002341aedf67c9d34.png?imageMogr2/rquality/85/thumbnail/258x/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to Read an Earnings Report\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nViews 780K](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-introduction-to-earnings-report-58661-220562077)\n\n- [![recommend-img](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17326765923894507261095-1120x720-%E5%89%96%E6%9E%90%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A.png?imageMogr2/rquality/85/thumbnail/258x/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\\\\\n\\\\\nDissecting Trending Industries\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nViews 79K](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-market-insights-how-to-analyze-the-weight-loss-drug-market-116944-240319022)\n\n- [![recommend-img](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17326768290968904994895-1120x720-%E7%9C%8B%E8%B4%A2%E6%8A%A5.png?imageMogr2/rquality/85/thumbnail/258x/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\\\\\n\\\\\nDecode Earnings with 12 Infographics\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nViews 480K](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-01-four-common-methods-for-valuing-a-stock-113256-230850033)\n\n- [![recommend-img](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com/2023092800004424795f29ad579.png?imageMogr2/rquality/85/thumbnail/258x/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to Reduce Investment Risk?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nViews 28K](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-01-what-is-investment-risk-107895-230549124)\n\n- [![recommend-img](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com/20230928000044006ba9d0798f1.png?imageMogr2/rquality/85/thumbnail/258x/ignore-error/1/format/webp)\\\\\n\\\\\nTrading Tutorials -

        "markdown": "# Meta is uniting the revenue streams it has used to pay more than four million creators\n\nBy [Sam Gutelle](https://www.tubefilter.com/author/sam-gutelle/ \"Posts by Sam Gutelle\")\u202210/03/2024\u2022\n\n![Meta is uniting the revenue streams it has used to pay more than four million creators](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/facebook-creator-monetization-1920x1131.jpg)\n\n**Facebook** creators have multiple monetization options to choose from, and **Meta** is now uniting its revenue streams within a single, centralized program. The [Facebook Content Monetization Beta](https://creators.facebook.com/tools/facebook-content-monetization), currently open on an invite-only basis, allows creators to profit from in-stream spots, Reels ads, and performance-based payouts without needing to qualify separately for each revenue stream.\n\nSince 2017, Facebook has offered payouts to creators who monetize through various revenue-sharing programs. The [in-stream ads](https://www.tubefilter.com/2017/08/17/facebook-in-stream-mid-roll-ads/) that appear in the Facebook feed arrived before the short-form content boom. Once Reels took off, Facebook turned on the monetization faucet for short-form creators by equipping them with [ads on Reels](https://www.tubefilter.com/2022/02/23/creators-can-now-run-ads-reels-take-home-revenue/) and [performance-based payouts](https://www.tubefilter.com/2023/05/09/meta-facebook-reels-ad-revenue-monetization-program/) that scale with viewership.\n\nAs those revenue streams [blew up](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/02/29/facebook-no-monthly-limits-meta-performance-bonus-monetization/), the plethora of Facebook monetization options began to get a bit confusing, so the platform is now looking to simplify. Once Facebook users are eligible for the Creator Monetization Beta, they can earn revenue across [all of the moneymaking formats](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/monetize-content-facebooks-new-streamlined-program/) Meta has made available.\n\n![Tubefilter](/wp-content/themes/tubefilter/images/logo_main.svg)\n\n### Subscribe for daily Tubefilter Top Stories\n\nSubscribe\n\nAt first glance, the new program sounds like YouTube\u2019s Partner Program, which is also a centralized revenue-sharing framework that includes [multiple forms](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/03/28/youtube-partner-program-shorts-monetization-ads-one-year-stats/) of monetization. But there are key differences between the two programs. YouTube Partner membership is contingent on viewership, subscriber, and watch time benchmarks that change depending on any particular creator\u2019s primary upload format (long-form videos, Shorts, live broadcasts, etc.)\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, will have one standard for entry into the Creator Monetization beta. For now, an invitation is required, and Facebook plans to onboard one million creators to start. Additional invitations will be sent in the \u201ccoming months,\u201d and creators who want a piece of the pie can [let Facebook know](https://creators.facebook.com/content-monetization-interest-form?locale=en_US) by request access to the new monetization program.\n\nOpen enrollment for the Creator Monetization Beta won\u2019t begin until 2025, but when it does, Facebook will have an opportunity to add more members to a monetization ecosystem that already serves millions. More than four million creators have earned from Facebook since 2017, and that massive number is just a starting point.\n\n### Subscribe for daily Tubefilter Top Stories\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest and breaking creator and online video news delivered right to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Related Stories\n\n- [Facebook wants to take Performance Bonus earnings to the moon by removing monthly limits](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/02/29/facebook-no-monthly-limits-meta-performance-bonus-monetization/) [![Facebook wants to take Performance Bonus earnings to the moon by removing monthly limits](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/facebook-performance-bonus-660x389.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/02/29/facebook-no-monthly-limits-meta-performance-bonus-monetization/)\n- [Facebook merges Reels, long-form videos, and live content with new video player](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/04/04/facebook-reels-long-form-live-new-full-screen-video-player/) [![Facebook merges Reels, long-form videos, and live content with new video player](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/facebook-reels-player-180x106.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/04/04/facebook-reels-long-form-live-new-full-screen-video-player/)\n- [Instagram is testing a program that turns creators into AI chatbots](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/04/17/instagram-meta-creator-ai-influencer-chatbots/) [![Instagram is testing a program that turns creators into AI chatbots](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meta-facebook-creator-ai-180x106.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/04/17/instagram-meta-creator-ai-influencer-chatbots/)\n- [Meta is using AI to power brand and creator matchmaking on Facebook and Instagram](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/05/03/meta-instagram-facebook-reels-ai-newfronts-pitch/) [![Meta is using AI to power brand and creator matchmaking on Facebook and Instagram](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/facebook-creator-marketplace-180x106.jpg)](https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/05/03/meta-instagram-facebook-reels-ai-newfronts-pitch/)\n\n![Tubefilter](https://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/themes/tubefilter/images/logo_main.svg)\n\n## Newsletter\n\nSubscribe for daily Tubefilter Top Stories\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Trending Stories\n\n- [Honey\u2019s business model is \u201can adpocalypse all day every day\u201d for creators.

We'll also answer some frequently asked questions regarding the company.\n\n## What You Will Learn\n\n1. **Business Model**: An in-depth look at how Meta Platforms generates revenue and sustains its operations.\n2. **SWOT Analysis**: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of Meta Platforms in 2024.\n3. **Competitors**: A review of Meta\u2019s main competitors and the competitive landscape.\n4. **FAQs**: Answers to commonly asked questions about Meta Platforms.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Meta Platforms' business model relies heavily on advertising revenue, but the company is diversifying into new technological realms such as the metaverse.\n- Despite facing several challenges, Meta Platforms has significant strengths, including a vast user base and strong brand recognition.\n- The competitive landscape is heating up with emerging players and existing giants like Google, Apple, and TikTok.\n\n## Business Model\n\n### Revenue Streams\n\nMeta Platforms primarily generates revenue through advertising. The company\u2019s extensive user base across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger provides a fertile ground for advertisers. Here are the primary revenue streams:\n\n1. **Advertising**: This is the core revenue stream. Businesses pay Meta to place their advertisements on its platforms, benefiting from advanced targeting options based on user data.\n2. **VR/AR**: With the acquisition of Oculus, Meta is making significant strides in the virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) sectors. This is seen as a future revenue stream as the technology matures.\n3. **E-commerce**: Instagram Shopping and Facebook Marketplace are growing areas that could contribute significantly to future revenues.\n4. **Subscription Services**: While not a major revenue stream yet, there is potential for subscription-based services, particularly in the context of the metaverse.\n\n### Cost Structure\n\nMeta's cost structure includes R&D, marketing, and data center operations. The company invests heavily in:\n\n1. **Research and Development**: Particularly in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality.\n2. **Marketing**: To attract new users and retain existing ones.\n3. **Infrastructure**: Data centers, servers, and other technology infrastructure to support its vast network.\n\n## SWOT Analysis\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. **Extensive User Base**: With billions of users across its platforms, Meta has a significant reach.\n2. **Strong Brand Recognition**: Meta\u2019s platforms are household names globally.\n3. **Advanced Advertising Tools**: The company offers some of the most advanced targeting options for advertisers.\n4. **Innovative Culture**: Significant investments in R&D ensure that Meta remains at the cutting edge of technology.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. **Privacy Concerns**: Ongoing issues with data privacy have tarnished the company\u2019s reputation.\n2. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Meta is under intense scrutiny from regulators worldwide, which could limit its operational flexibility.\n3. **Dependence on Advertising**: A significant portion of revenue comes from advertising, making the company vulnerable to changes in this market.\n\n### Opportunities\n\n1. **Metaverse**: Meta\u2019s vision for the metaverse could open up new revenue streams and reshape digital interaction.\n2. **E-commerce Expansion**: Growing its e-commerce capabilities could diversify revenue sources.\n3. **VR/AR Technologies**: Continued investment in VR and AR could lead to new business opportunities.\n\n### Threats\n\n1. **Competitive Pressure**: Increasing competition from other tech giants and emerging players.\n2. **Regulatory Risks**: Potential for restrictive regulations that could impact business operations.\n3. **Market Saturation**: Slowing user growth in key markets could impact future growth prospects.\n\n## Competitors\n\n### Google (Alphabet Inc.)\n\nGoogle remains one of Meta\u2019s most significant competitors. Both companies dominate the digital advertising market. However, Google\u2019s diverse portfolio, including search, YouTube, and other ventures, gives it a competitive edge.\n\n### Apple Inc.\n\nApple\u2019s entry into the advertising space and its focus on privacy have posed challenges for Meta. The introduction of iOS features that limit data collection has impacted Meta\u2019s advertising effectiveness.\n\n### TikTok (ByteDance)\n\nTikTok has rapidly grown to become a formidable competitor. Its unique content format and high engagement levels have attracted a younger demographic, posing a threat to Meta\u2019s user base and advertising revenue.\n\n### Snap Inc.\n\nSnapchat, with its focus on AR and younger audiences, is another key competitor. Snap\u2019s innovations in AR filters and short-form content have kept it relevant in the competitive social media landscape.\n\n### Twitter\n\nWhile not as large as Meta, Twitter remains a significant player, especially in real-time news and public discourse. Its recent changes under new leadership could further enhance its competitive position.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMeta Platforms stands at a critical juncture in 2024. Its strengths, including a vast user base and strong brand recognition, provide a solid foundation. However, the company must navigate significant challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and increasing competition. The shift towards the metaverse represents a high-risk, high-reward strategy that could redefine the company\u2019s future.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What is Meta Platforms' main source of revenue?\n\nMeta Platforms primarily generates revenue through advertising. The company\u2019s platforms offer advanced targeting options, making them attractive to advertisers.\n\n### How is Meta Platforms addressing privacy concerns?\n\nMeta has implemented several measures to address privacy concerns, including enhanced data security protocols and more transparent data usage policies. However, privacy remains a significant challenge for the company.\n\n### What is the metaverse, and why is Meta investing in it?\n\nThe metaverse is a virtual, interconnected space where users can interact in real-time through avatars. Meta is investing in the metaverse as part of its long-term strategy to create new revenue streams and redefine digital interaction.\n\n### Who are Meta Platforms' main competitors?\n\nMeta\u2019s main competitors include Google (Alphabet Inc.), Apple Inc., TikTok (ByteDance), Snap Inc., and Twitter. Each of these companies competes with Meta in various aspects of digital advertising, social media, and technology.\n\n### What are Meta Platforms' growth opportunities?\n\nMeta has several growth opportunities, including the development of the metaverse, expansion into e-commerce, and advancements in VR/AR technologies.\n\n### What challenges does Meta Platforms face in 2024?\n\nMeta faces several challenges, including privacy concerns, regulatory scrutiny, intense competition, and market saturation in key areas.

That is a 1280% return in 12 years.**\n\n- From 2015 to 2023, Meta\u2019s revenue has **grown from $17.9 billion to over $134.9 billion.** **A CAGR of 28.35%**.

The company\u2019s FoA division is the primary reason for the growth.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61841000-5f83-4afd-ad01-611fb1a2c522_1039x337.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61841000-5f83-4afd-ad01-611fb1a2c522_1039x337.png)\n\nAs of Q2 2024, Meta Platforms has approximately a 20% market share of the U.S. digital advertising market. That puts the company behind Microsoft and Google (Alphabet Inc) at the current time.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d884c21-156f-4b01-8601-bcbe34aa42de_498x562.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d884c21-156f-4b01-8601-bcbe34aa42de_498x562.png) Source: https://www.emarketer.com/content/meta-ad-share-more-than-share-of-time-spent\n\nThat performance is strongly linked to the strong performance of Meta\u2019s Family of Apps, as its Reality Labs segment is still operating at a loss.\n\n**Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)**\n\nMeta\u2019s FoA is its Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger social media apps.\n\nMeta Platforms' revenue continues to increase thanks to its platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIt increased 22% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024, leading to a net income of $13.45 billion.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4a2898-6cdb-4ad2-87d2-99e30fd127e0_1806x616.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4a2898-6cdb-4ad2-87d2-99e30fd127e0_1806x616.png)\n\n**Reality Labs**\n\nReality Labs is a division of Meta that focuses on the research, development, and sales of Virtual and Augmented reality technology.\n\nMeta\u2019s Reality Labs division reported losses of $4.48 billion for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nHowever, as the technology is still relatively new and expensive, this is as expected. As tech evolves, prices become more affordable, and adoption increases, there is a strong belief this segment will contribute more positively toward Meta\u2019s financial results.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7587a05-b020-4b38-b1c8-3bfc737de640_1109x496.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7587a05-b020-4b38-b1c8-3bfc737de640_1109x496.png)\n\nMeta heavily relies on the robust business model of its family of apps. Facebook, in particular, has enjoyed monumental growth in the last decade, and the company expects this growth to continue.\n\n#### **Growth Drivers \ud83d\udcc8**\n\nSeveral growth drivers contribute to Meta Platform\u2019s continued expansion. Let\u2019s get into each:\n\n1. **Advertising Revenue:**\n\n   - Facebook generated $134.9 billion in revenue during 2023, with its mobile app bringing in around $71 billion ( [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/#:~:text=Facebook's%20annual%20revenue%20increased%20by%2015.6%25%20in%202023%20to%20%24134.9%20billion.)).\n\n   - Ad impressions delivered across Meta\u2019s FoA increased by 10% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024 ( [Meta](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx)).\n\n   - The average price per ad also increased by 10% year-over-year ( [Meta](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx)).\n2. **User Base Expansion:**\n\n   - The Family Daily Active People (DAP) across those platforms for the period reached 3.27 billion, up 7%.\n\n   - According to Statista, as of April 2024, Meta\u2019s FoA has 8 billion active users, including Facebook (3,5 billion), Instagram (2.5 billion), WhatsApp (2 billion), and Messenger (1 billion).\n\n   - To compare, YouTube has 2,504 billion active users, while TikTok and Twitter stats show 1,582 billion and 611 million, respectively.\n3. **E-commerce Integration:**\n\n   - Meta has created additional revenue streams from its FoA by integrating e-commerce features across many platforms. Businesses use these platforms to sell products and services directly to users.\n\n**10-Year Growth Rates**\n\nAs the popularity of Meta\u2019s social media platforms has increased over the past decade, so has its revenue. In 2014, the company reported an approximate revenue of $12.47 billion. Fast-forward 10 years to 2024, and the conglomerate\u2019s revenue is predicted to be around $150 billion.\n\nMeta Platforms' revenue has compounded by 30.21% in the last decade. Earnings Per Share have grown 35.28% CAGR, free cash flow per share has grown 26.17%, and return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged above 30%, indicating a formidable business model at Meta.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb090a99a-b28d-495e-bad4-153ccb5d79b6_1600x572.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb090a99a-b28d-495e-bad4-153ccb5d79b6_1600x572.png)\n\n#### **Competitive advantage (Moat) \ud83c\udff0**\n\nMeta Platforms have a wide economic moat, with intangible assets and network effects being their moat sources.\n\n**Network Effects**\n\nMeta benefits from network effects due to its large and popular user base across several social media platforms and apps.\n\n- **User Growth:** As Meta\u2019s social media platforms attract more users, the network's value increases, making it more attractive for future sign-ups. As of 2024, the Daily Active People (DAP) using Meta's apps increased to 3.27 billion, 200 million more than the previous year.\n\n- **Data Accumulation: As more users join Meta\u2019s platforms, more data is collected, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of its advertising services.**\n\n- **Barriers to Entry:** Meta\u2019s social media platforms' sheer size and popularity make it increasingly difficult for competitors to enter the market. Replicating such a successful and extensive network is difficult and expensive.\n\n\n**Intangible Assets**\n\nMeta Platforms boasts a strong portfolio of intangible assets, primarily driven by its brand recognition and the user data it has collected.\n\n- **User Data:** The company has collected vast user data across its FoA. That data appeals to advertisers, allowing them to create highly personalized advertising campaigns targeting specific demographics with their products and services.\n\n- **Brand Recognition: Facebook is one of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. As of March 2024, it had a 45.5% market share based on the share of social media website visits ( [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265773/market-share-of-the-most-popular-social-media-websites-in-the-us/)).**\n\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7149cd68-988f-41ae-a23b-e32ac3c41f25_889x573.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7149cd68-988f-41ae-a23b-e32ac3c41f25_889x573.png)\n\n- **Technology and algorithms:** Meta has invested in and continues to invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. These improve user experience and further increase the effectiveness of their advertising services.\n\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 intangible assets and network effects are its strongest competitive advantages.\n\nThose moat sources allow Meta to maintain a competitive edge over its competitors in the social media, marketing, and digital advertising sectors.\n\n#### **Management \ud83d\udd74\ud83c\udffb**\n\nKey executives and their insider holdings:\n\n1. **Mark Elliot Zuckerberg**\n\n   - **Title:** Co-founder, Chairman, CEO, and Member of the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\n\n   - **Ownership: 344.52M shares**\n\n   - **Market Value of Shares: $168.74B**\n\n   - **Tenure: 20 years (since 2004)**\n\n   - **CEO Since: 2004**\n\n   - **Track Record: Led Meta from the beginning and through all significant growth phases, such as the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.**\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8063cf0-c7c6-41ac-b5c6-5f7ac168053e_1600x1066.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8063cf0-c7c6-41ac-b5c6-5f7ac168053e_1600x1066.png)\n\n2. **Sheryl Kara Sandberg**\n\n   - **Title:** Former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Meta Platforms, Inc.\n\n   - **Ownership: 1.27M shares**\n\n   - **Market Value of Shares: $621.99M**\n\n   - **Tenure: 14 years at Meta (2008\u20132022).**\n\n   - **COO Since: 2008 to 2022**\n\n   - **Track Record: Sandberg is lauded for her pivotal role in scaling Facebook\u2019s advertising business.**\n3. **Christopher K. Cox**\n\n   - **Title: Chief Product Officer of Meta Platforms, Inc.**\n\n   - **Ownership: 397.98K shares**\n\n   - **Market Value of Shares: $194.93M**\n\n   - **Tenure: Joined in 2005, with a brief departure in 2019, and returned in 2020.**\n\n   - **Track Record: Cox played a leading role in developing Facebook\u2019s News Feed.**\n\nFacebook has marked its 20th birthday, and what stands out is that most of its key executives have worked with the company for at least half that time. They each also hold significant shares in the business, although the others pale in comparison to Zuckerberg\u2019s 344.52M.\n\nOf course, as one of the company's founders, Zuckerberg has remained a key figure since its founding.\n\nIn the Second Quarter 2024 Results [Conference Call](https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/583765285) hosted by Kenneth Dorell, a Director of Meta, Zuckerberg stated that what's pleased him most is the increase in young adults using Facebook and the steady growth of a new platform, Threads.\n\nThis focus on young adults via Facebook and a trendy new solution should help Meta maintain a competitive edge despite the rapid rise of competitor platforms.\n\n**Risk Factors \u274c**\n\nThe main risks for Meta Platforms:\n\n**Regulatory and Legal Challenges:** Meta has consistently faced backlash from regulators and consumers for several reasons. Data privacy, content moderation, and antitrust issues are the common causes of complaints.\n\nThese challenges could eventually lead to regulatory fines or restrictions or potentially forced changes to Meta\u2019s business practices.\n\n**Dependence on Advertising Revenue:** Another risk is the company\u2019s reliance on an advertising revenue model. Significant economic downturns could result in businesses spending less on advertising.\n\nFurthermore, the continued rise of competitors, specifically TikTok in recent years, could also threaten that ad revenue.\n\n**Technological Disruption:** The rate of technological advances is another risk to the long-term success of Meta\u2019s social media platforms. Trends constantly shift, and the company could struggle to stay relevant.\n\nThe rapid rise of TikTok is a prime example. The social media platform has experienced a meteoric rise in users and is proving increasingly popular with Gen Z and the Alpha generation.\n\n**Valuation Risk**\n\n- **Relative Valuation:** Meta is trading at a P/E ratio of approximately 27, below its median of 29.46. Although the median PE is high, we saw Meta Platforms trade at 8.5 times earnings in 2022.\n\n- Furthermore, Meta faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny concerning privacy practices, which could impact its ability to maintain high growth rates.\n\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63366351-974f-45a6-8234-e0e23846ccd6_1080x1156.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63366351-974f-45a6-8234-e0e23846ccd6_1080x1156.jpeg)\n\nTired of\u00a0**boring**,\u00a0**text-heavy**\u00a0investing newsletters?\n\nMy good friend\u00a0**[Carbon Finance](https://www.carbonfinance.io/subscribe)**\u00a0sends out a\u00a0**weekly visual newsletter**\u00a0with the\u00a0**most important** infographics, insights, and insider trades.\n\nIt\u2019s\u00a0**completely free** and only takes\u00a0**5 minutes to\u00a0read**.\n\nJoin\u00a0**16,500+**\u00a0investors!\u00a0**Click\u00a0the\u00a0button**\u00a0below to **subscribe now**\n\n[Subscribe Here](https://www.carbonfinance.io/subscribe)\n\n* * *\n\n### Valuation \u2696\ufe0f\n\n**Multiple Comparisons**\n\nMeta Platforms is trading at a PE of 27x earnings, lower than its median of 29.46 and considerably lower than its highest\u00a0PE range of 109.4 times.\n\nThese figures indicate that the current P/E ratio is close to its 10-year median P/E.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ccd0c6e-4dea-4667-b313-1f61b6e19cda_1807x542.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ccd0c6e-4dea-4667-b313-1f61b6e19cda_1807x542.png)\n\nThe Free Cash Flow Yield is 3.72% vs. its historical median of 3.32%.\n\nThis indicates Meta generates significant free cash flow relative to its stock price.

Add in the exponential growth of [AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence) and automation, and it's no surprise the tech job market has been roiled over the past few years.\n\nAs technology advances and companies attempt to keep pace amid constant volatility, it begs the question: Will the uncertainty of the tech job market -- slow job growth, continuous layoffs and skill shortages -- continue into 2025?\n\nHere are some statistics that clarify the tech job market in 2025.\n\n## 1\\. Tech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow at twice the rate of the overall workforce in the next decade\n\nTech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow much faster than average, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association's (CompTIA) 2024 \" [State of the Tech Workforce](https://www.comptia.org/content/research/state-of-the-tech-workforce)\" report. The report projected tech job growth from 6 million in 2024 to 7.1 million in 2034.\n\nAccording to research from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/), computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than average from 2023 to 2033, with a projected 356,700 job openings annually.\n\n## 2\\. More than 90% of organizations worldwide will be affected by the IT skills shortage by 2026\n\nBy 2026, the IT skills shortage will become a significant problem for most organizations globally, resulting in $5.5 trillion in losses, according to an IDC [survey](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52128824) of North American IT leaders. Organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry [predicted](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/talent-crunch-future-of-work) the skills shortage might leave as many as 85 million unfilled tech-related jobs by 2030.\n\nThe IT skills shortage may already be here. No longer a looming issue, AI and other technologies continue to advance faster than workers and organizations can react. Staffing firm [Robert Half](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/building-tech-teams) reported that 95% of tech leaders who responded to its survey currently face challenges finding skilled workers.\n\n## 3\\. 48% of tech organizations are prioritizing upskilling and cross-skilling over new hires\n\n[The Linux Foundation](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/2023-state-of-tech-talent-report-acquiring-and-retaining-technical-talent-in-2023-kh-0) reported that a growing number of organizations, in response to technological advances and a tough labor market, are investing internally to close skill gaps rather than hiring new talent or consultants.\n\nOrganizations continue to prioritize [upskilling](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/upskilling), [reskilling](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/definition/reskilling) and cross-skilling to meet their needs. After all, the half-life of technology skills is as short as 2.5 years, according to [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2023/09/reskilling-in-the-age-of-ai). The World Economic Forum, back in October 2020, [noted](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/) that more than half of workers require skilling of some type by 2025 due to rapid technology advancements.\n\n## 4\\. Python is the most in-demand programming language\n\nAccording to Indeed's \"Tapping Into Today's Tech Talent\" [report](https://www.indeed.com/lead/tapping-into-todays-tech-talent) from October 2024, [Python](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Python) is the most in-demand skill in job listings, followed by experience with [AWS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/definition/Amazon-Web-Services), which enjoyed the largest growth in demand in the last year, as well as Oracle, Java and JavaScript.\n\n[PyTorch](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/PyTorch), Rust, [TensorFlow](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/TensorFlow), Flutter and Dart were listed as other fast-growing areas. Xamarin, Erlang, Azure and iOS faced the biggest declines in demand, according to the report, with Erlang among the list of [dying programming languages](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/5-dead-programming-languages-we-should-never-forget).\n\n## 5\\. The worldwide average salary for IT professionals is $88,448\n\n[Skillsoft's \"2024-25 IT Skills and Salary Report\"](https://cdn.bfldr.com/SDYPVW60/at/vfhxpgf7bh3qnc8bhnj9wk7/Skillsoft_IT_Skills_Salary_Report_2024.pdf) stated the average worldwide salary for IT professionals has increased nearly 5% since last year. North America recorded the highest average salary of $113,211 in comparison to three other regions: Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia-Pacific.\n\n[C-level](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/C-level) IT executives earned the highest salaries, according to the report, followed by IT architecture and design, and then cloud computing. In North America, the highest salaries are in the IT software sector. Meanwhile, IT professionals in the education sector reported the lowest average salary.\n\n## 6\\. LinkedIn job listings referencing AI have more than doubled worldwide from 2021 to 2023\n\nLinkedIn's November 2023 \"Future of Work Report: AI at Work\" [highlighted](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/economicgraph/en-us/PDF/future-of-work-report-ai-november-2023.pdf) the ever-increasing demand for AI skills as organizations integrate AI into their business practices. Other hiring platforms concur. [Indeed's Hiring Lab](https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/03/14/march-2024-us-labor-market-update/) reported a 30-fold increase in [generative AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI)-related jobs from January 2023 to February 2024, though they still make up a relatively small part of total jobs.\n\nThat is changing as organizations focus on [AI skills entering 2025](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/9-top-AI-and-machine-learning-trends). A [ResumeTemplates.com survey](https://www.resumetemplates.com/4-in-10-companies-will-replace-workers-with-ai-in-2025/) found that 87% of leaders who plan to hire list AI experience as valuable for job seekers. Plus, AI skills benefit current employees. For example, in its [2025 salary guide](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/salary-guide/technology), Robert Half reported that 44% of organizations boost pay for workers with AI and [machine learning](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML) skills.\n\n## 7\\. Nontech industries hired more tech talent workers than the tech industry in 2023\n\nCBRE, a commercial real estate services and investment firm, found tech industry hiring is slowing. Nontech industries hire more tech talent than tech industries, a first in the CBRE \"[Scoring Tech Talent\" report](https://www.cbre.com/insights/books/scoring-tech-talent-2024)'s 11-year history.\n\nWhile the tech industry added nearly 29,000 tech talent jobs in 2023, the report noted professional and business services, excluding tech, netted almost 50,000 jobs, followed by roughly 45,000 in the transportation, warehousing and wholesale sectors.\n\n## 8\\. More than 225,000 tech employees have been laid off in 2024\n\nLayoffs, rampant in the tech industry since the pandemic, aren't stopping. [TrueUp's layoff tracker](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs) reported more than 1,000 rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting nearly 700 people per day.\n\nContinuous layoffs parallel an uptick in unemployment for tech workers. According to [CompTIA's \"Tech Jobs Report\"](https://www.comptia.org/content/tech-jobs-report), in June 2024, unemployment for IT professionals reached 3.7%, the highest mark since August 2020.\n\n## 9\\. 56% of tech managers are loosening experience requirements to speed the hiring process\n\nTo combat hiring challenges, organizations are deprioritizing experience to help find and hire tech talent faster, according to Robert Half's 2025 salary guide. Additionally, the salary guide found technology leaders are taking other measures to attract top candidates, including 45% of leaders who've decided to increase pay.\n\n_Alison Roller is a freelance writer with experience in tech, HR and marketing._\n\n#### Related Resources\n\n- [The Impact of AI on the CIO Career](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9059/633088)\u2013Talk\n- [Leveraging Learning to Create Community and Purpose in the Workplace](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/16593/631151)\u2013Talk\n- [Part One: A Day in the Life of a Threat Analyst](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/19394/626557)\u2013Replay\n- [How To Set Up An HR Function: The Essential Guide And Checklist](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1722402043_633.html)\u2013Sage\n\n#### Dig Deeper on IT career paths\n\n- [**Tech sector layoffs explained: What you need to know**\\\\\n\\\\\n![AmandaHetler](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/hetler_amanda.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Amanda\u00a0Hetler](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Tech-sector-layoffs-explained-What-you-need-to-know)\n- [**Tech sector layoffs mount amid AI investment frenzy**\\\\\n\\\\\n![SebastianKlovig Skelton](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/computerweekly/Sebastian-Klovig-Skelton-CW-contributor.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Sebastian\u00a0Klovig Skelton](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366606035/Tech-sector-layoffs-mount-amid-AI-investment-frenzy)\n- [**AI and cyber skills worryingly lacking, say business leaders**\\\\\n\\\\\n![ClareMcDonald](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/computerweekly/Clare-Ellen-McDonald-140px.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Clare\u00a0McDonald](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366593173/AI-and-cyber-skills-worryingly-lacking-say-business-leaders)\n- [**A bad tech job market wants good AI skills**\\\\\n\\\\\n![PatrickThibodeau](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Patrick\u00a0Thibodeau](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/news/366574674/A-bad-tech-job-market-wants-good-AI-skills)\n\n[Search Networking](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/)\n\n- [What is network management?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-management)\nNetwork management is a multifaceted discipline that provides network administrators with the tools, protocols and processes to ...\n\n- [What is network downtime?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-downtime)\nNetwork downtime refers to inaccessibility to part or all of a network due to the failure of hardware, software or some ...\n\n- [What is PSTN (public switched telephone network)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/PSTN)\nPSTN (public switched telephone network) is the world's collection of interconnected voice-oriented public telephone networks via...\n\n\n[Search Security](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/)\n\n- [What is a public key and how does it work?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)\nIn cryptography, a public key is a large numerical value that is used to encrypt data.\n\n- [What is a proxy firewall?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/proxy-firewall)\nA proxy firewall is a network security system that protects network resources by filtering messages at the application layer.\n\n- [What is a public key certificate?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key-certificate)\nA public key certificate is a digitally signed document that serves to validate the sender's authorization and name.\n\n\n[Search CIO](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/)\n\n- [What is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act)\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act or GLBA), also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, is a federal law enacted in ...\n\n- [What is a CVO (chief visionary officer)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/CVO)\nThe CVO (chief visionary officer) is a newer C-suite title where the holder is expected to have a broad and comprehensive ...\n\n- [What is a balanced scorecard and how does the methodology work?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/balanced-scorecard-methodology)\nThe balanced scorecard is a management system aimed at translating an organization's strategic goals into a set of organizational...\n\n\n[Search HRSoftware](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/)\n\n- [What is employee self-service (ESS)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/definition/employee-self-service)\nEmployee self-service (ESS) is a widely used human resources technology that enables employees to perform many job-related ...\n\n- [What is DEI?

        "markdown": "# 2024 Year in Interviews\n\n![Metaview ](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.metaview.ai%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2023%2F10%2FScreenshot-Oct-9.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nMetaview\n\n19 Dec 2024 \u2022 7 min read\n\nIn 2024, we captured over 1 million interviews on [Metaview](https://www.metaview.ai/?ref=content.metaview.ai) across geographies, departments, and types of companies. Looking back on a year that continued to be full of evolution and tumult for the world of hiring, we wanted to take a peek into the black box of interviews to go beyond the headlines and understand what candidates and interviewers were actually discussing. So we built [Metaview Trends](https://trends.metaview.ai/?ref=content.metaview.ai). For the first time ever, you can search for any keyword or phrase to understand how it\u2019s trended in interview conversations throughout the year. Here\u2019s a glimpse into some of the top trends we uncovered from interviews that happened in 2024.\n\n# 1\\. AI officially became mainstream\n\nWe\u2019re now more than two years out from the moment GenAI burst onto the scene, and the influence of AI shows no signs of slowing down. According to PwC\u2019s [Global AI Jobs Barometer report,](https://www.pwc.com/bs/en/press-releases/pwc-2024-global-ai-jobs-barometer.html?ref=content.metaview.ai#:~:text=PwC%20research%20also%20finds%20that,faster%20than%20for%20all%20jobs.) postings for AI jobs are growing 3.5x faster than for all jobs and jobs that require AI skills can carry up to a 25% wage premium. Given all of the hype in this space, we\u2019d expect to see interviewers increasingly probing AI skills and candidates wanting to show off their AI knowledge.\n\nOur data shows a continued upward trend of AI mentions across job departments in 2024. Overall, we\u2019ve seen mentions of AI increase about 35% since the start of the year and frequency of mention is now at an all-time high for the year.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/AI.png)\n\nSimilarly, discussion around \u201cprompt engineering\u201d hit the year\u2019s high in November.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/prompt-engineering-1.png)\n\nThough discussion of prompt engineering was, of course, most popular in Engineering interviews, it was mentioned in interviews for all departments, highlighting the fact that AI skills for technical and non-technical roles alike continue to be a major differentiator for top talent.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/prompt-engineering--dpts-.png)\n\nFrom March onward, we saw that candidates began to mention prompt engineering even more frequently than interviewers did\u2014which supports the idea that candidates are increasingly proactively promoting their AI literacy, even when not explicitly asked about it. It\u2019s no surprise we\u2019re seeing a surge in these skills in response to the obvious need for talent of all types to get comfortable leveraging AI to remain competitive.\n\nIn their recent [Octoverse report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/?ref=content.metaview.ai), GitHub shared that for the first time, Python surpassed JavaScript as the most popular language on the platform. They explained, \u201cThe rise in Python usage correlates with large communities of people joining the open source community from across the STEM world rather than the traditional community of software developers.\u201c We\u2019ve seen this trend reflected in interview conversations, where we\u2019ve seen that Python has been mentioned more than twice as frequently as JavaScript throughout the year, confirming that AI is changing the face of software development as it opens up coding to new groups of people.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/Python-vs.-JavaScript.png)\n\nWe also saw that discussion around \u201cAI agents\u201d overtook discussion of \u201cAI assistants\u201d earlier this year, with the highest frequency of mention happening in Engineering, Product, and GTM interviews. With much buzz about agentic AI becoming the next big thing, we expect to see that trend continue into 2025.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/AI-agent-vs.-AI-assistant-1.png)\n\n# 2\\. The debate around workplace flexibility raged on\n\nAs companies continue to wrestle with what workplace norms should look like in a post-COVID world, it\u2019s no surprise that chatter around remote, hybrid, and in-office work remained high all year. \u200bA 2024 report by [Flex Index](https://www.flex.scoopforwork.com/reports/fortune-500?ref=content.metaview.ai) revealed that 82% of Fortune 500 companies still offer flexible work, while only 18% require full-time in-office work. So how did we see these trends manifest in interview conversations?\n\nThough relatively few companies have actually enforced full return-to-office mandates, we saw that mentions of \u201creturn to office\u201d have been on an overall upward trajectory since the beginning of 2024, peaking in October. With a number of high profile companies like Amazon and Alphabet continuing to push for more stringent in-office plans, this more frequent mention could be a sign that employers are increasingly looking for talent that\u2019s open to less flexible in-office attendance, and that employees want clarity on what employers\u2019 expectations will be.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/return-to-office.png)\n\nMentions of \u201cremote work\u201d remained higher than mentions of \u201chybrid work\u201d throughout the year. Interestingly, we saw a switch from May onward where candidates started mentioning remote work more often than interviewers did, which may be a sign that there\u2019s growing candidate demand for fully flexible work as many companies swing back to full or partial in-office return. Discussion of flexible work options has remained relatively constant throughout the year, showing that this will continue to be a topic of interest for both sides of the interview.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/remote-work-vs.-hybrid-work.png)\n\n# **3\\. The tides of culture turned**\n\n2024 has been a year of reckoning for workplace culture, with heated discourse about which values have a place at work\u2014and which don\u2019t. To much controversy, SHRM announced it was officially eliminating \u201cequity\u201d from its DEI agenda and big-name companies like Boeing and Ford disbanded DEI departments entirely, kicking off debates about merit versus diversity. So how did these hot-button topics show up in conversations with candidates?\n\nWe saw that mentions of DEI peaked in January and dipped to their lowest point in May. In December so far, DEI was mentioned about 30% less frequently than it was at the start of the year. Aside from a blip in September, DEI has consistently been mentioned more frequently by candidates than by interviewers.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/DEI.png)\n\nDEI was most frequently mentioned in People-related interviews, with the lowest relative mentions happening in Engineering and Product interviews.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/DEI--dpt-.png)\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve seen that discussions around \u201ccompany culture\u201d peaked in June, and, as of December, were over 40% higher than they were at the start of the year. So while talk of DEI is on a downward trend, conversation about company culture and values continues to heat up. This suggests that when bringing in new talent, it\u2019s increasingly important for both sides of the table to have frank conversations about preferred working norms and values and whether there\u2019s a real match.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/company-culture.png)\n\n# 4\\. The macroeconomic mood started looking up\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough couple of years for the global job market. Between a barrage of announcements about mass layoffs and hiring freezes that felt never-ending, the mood sometimes felt bleak. But, things are definitely starting to look up. There\u2019s plenty of data to support the global job market\u2019s rebound in 2024: For example, the US economy added 227,000 new jobs in November and [total job postings are back to pre-pandemic norms](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/how-global-labour-markets-can-repeat-2023-s-success-in-2024-davos24/?ref=content.metaview.ai#:~:text=While%20well%20below%202022%20peaks%2C%20total%20job,tracked%20by%20the%20Indeed%20Job%20Postings%20Index.) in countries like the US, the UK, and Canada.\n\nIn 2024 interviews, we saw that mention of terms like \u201crecession\u201d and \u201clayoff\u201d peaked at the start of the year, hitting their lowest points in the last months of the year. As of November, mentions of \u201crecession\u201d were over 35% lower than at the start of the year.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/recession.png)\n\nAs the economy continues to strengthen, we expect to see mention of these worries continue to dissipate as interviewers and candidates gain confidence in job security and workforce stability.\n\n# 5\\. Adaptability emerged as the key to future-proofing talent\n\nAs AI continues to change the face of what virtually all jobs look like, the only constant we can count on is continued change. Earlier this year, [LinkedIn reported](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/linkedin-most-in-demand-hard-and-soft-skills?ref=content.metaview.ai) that \u201cadaptability\u201d was a top skill of the moment and would continue to grow in demand. Our data shows that mentions of adaptability have been on a steady upward trend since the start of the year. Discussion around related traits like resiliency and problem solving also surged in popularity this year too, suggesting that even more so than technical skills or specific backgrounds, organizations are looking for talent that can roll with the punches and find ways to maintain their value as the pace of change accelerates.\n\n![](https://content.metaview.ai/content/images/2024/12/adaptability.png)\n\nAs we look forward to 2025, we\u2019re excited to see how AI will continue to reshape what workplaces and workforces look like. With the breakneck pace of innovation continuing, it\u2019s poised to be another year of incredible change and progress for both organizations and talent alike.

As the economy slowly shifts and technology rapidly evolves, change is unavoidable, but it doesn\u2019t need to be another hiring obstacle. In 2024, the companies who persevere will be the ones who don\u2019t fear shifts but embrace them.\n\nTo build and retain winning teams, leaders must stay on top of the latest talent acquisition trends. The hiring landscape is ever-evolving, along with the strategies, values, and expectations of the workforce. In response, businesses everywhere are rethinking who to hire, where work is done, and how to achieve their goals.\n\nWhether recruiting for creative, marketing or tech teams this year \u2013 if you hope to achieve success, these are the 2024 hiring trends and market shifts you can\u2019t ignore.\n\n1.

In addition, over 40% admit their teams are currently understaffed, listing employee turnover as the top reason for new jobs opening.\n\nThe [latest US jobs report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) supports our findings, showing there are currently more jobs open than talent available for hire. While recent headcount reductions introduced a wave of new candidates into the market, skilled professionals quickly found new opportunities, and job-switching remains at [a historical high](https://www.hiringlab.org/2023/11/15/indeeds-2024-us-jobs-hiring-trends-report/) across industries. Our recent poll of 1,000+ LinkedIn users revealed that 76% of candidates plan to switch jobs or companies in 2024.\n\nTo step ahead of the competition, attract top talent, and improve retention \u2013 leaders are making a strategic effort to be more empathetic toward their employees and prospective hires. Companies everywhere are revising their compensation packages, expanding their benefits offerings, and updating their hiring processes with job candidate preferences at heart.\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#2: Hybrid is the next normal.**\n\nOur 2024 Hiring Trends survey also demonstrated that today\u2019s employees value flexibility and autonomy more than ever before. 90% of job seeker respondents indicated they would leave on-site jobs for remote opportunities. After experiencing [the dual benefits of relaxed work-from-home policies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2020/02/12/top-5-benefits-of-remote-work-for-companies/?sh=4a917d1616c8), many individual contributors and managers alike are reluctant to return to the office.\n\nAt the same time, business leaders are increasingly in favor of in-person work, with more than 2 out of 3 hiring managers unveiling plans to return to the office at least for part of the time in 2024. In light of recent world events and economic developments, there\u2019s a renewed focus on workplace productivity across industries, and remote work\u2019s impact on employee performance remains a subject of debate.\n\nAs companies carefully balance their growth goals with job seeker expectations, 60% of hiring managers say that hybrid work will be the most common arrangement of 2024.

Last year also saw [a new bill](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/national-pay-transparency-bill-proposed/) introduced to congress that could require employers in all states to disclose pay ranges, if passed. This year, US pay transparency laws and company policies are expected to multiply, and hiring managers are increasingly disclosing pay upfront on their own accord.\n\nPay disclosure is not yet a nation-wide legal mandate in the US, but it is a competitive advantage for companies across states. 99% of creative, marketing and tech professionals responded they would be more likely to apply to companies that embrace pay transparency when asked in our 2024 Hiring Trends survey. The survey also found that 1 in 3 professionals still value compensation above all else.\n\nWhile job seekers have much to consider in 2024, salaries remain among the top reasons that organizations win and lose great hires. As recent pay transparency trends place a renewed focus on wages, companies everywhere are leveraging resources like [our 2024 Salary Guide](https://www.onwardsearch.com/salary-guide-2023/) to craft equitable and competitive pay ranges.\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#4: DEI is now DEIA.**\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) continues to be a focus for job seekers and hiring managers alike.

In fact, according to data from interviewing.io, a mock interview platform where candidates can practice for specific company interviews, the year-over-year increase of Meta interviews from January 2023 to January 2024 was 10X!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*diBzwPVYUUmQ0pMtmIud6g.png)\n\nHiring volume of FAANGs from [interviewing.io](https://interviewingio-metabase.herokuapp.com/public/dashboard/11313b19-b9fd-4532-9a3f-d2aad7e027c3)\n\nIf you look at the chart above showing hiring volume of different FAANG companies, you\u2019ll notice Meta has ramped up hiring in 2024, hiring significantly more engineers than other companies, and even holds a monopoly on engineering hiring. This uptick in hiring corresponds to Meta\u2019s strong 2023 economic performance and a jump in stock price from 2023 to 2024. With stock prices at all time highs, Meta is in a strong financial position to increase hiring. In this blog, I will explain how this current state of hiring affects interview candidates.\n\nIn September 2024, I finished and passed the Meta interview process for an IC4 software engineer. I was a recent candidate, and throughout my unique hiring process that lasted 9 months from January 2024 to September 2024, I have seen 2 waves of hiring at Meta. Although I am joining the company very soon, I will not pretend to have all the insider information on Meta\u2019s hiring practices\u2026\n\n## Create an account to read\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0story.\n\nThe\u00a0author made this story available to\u00a0Medium\u00a0members\u00a0only.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Medium, create a new account to read this story on us.\n\n[Continue in app](https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F485b9cc5b475&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderUser&%7Estage=regwall&source=-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------)\n\nOr, continue in mobile web\n\n[Sign up with Google](//medium.com/m/connect/google?state=google-%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Fchan-keith-96.medium.com%2F2024-meta-current-state-of-hiring-485b9cc5b475%3Fsource%3D-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------%26skipOnboarding%3D1%7Cregister&source=-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------)\n\n[Sign up with Facebook](//medium.com/m/connect/facebook?state=facebook-%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Fchan-keith-96.medium.com%2F2024-meta-current-state-of-hiring-485b9cc5b475%3Fsource%3D-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------%26skipOnboarding%3D1%7Cregister&source=-----485b9cc5b475---------------------post_regwall-----------)\n\nSign up with email\n\nAlready have an account?

This decline follows a trend of cautious hiring, reflecting companies' concerns about ongoing inflation and market volatility. While the broader job market remains resilient, this reduction in job postings suggests that businesses are adopting a wait-and-see approach, particularly in industries sensitive to economic conditions.\n- Looking Ahead: The tension between fostering job creation and managing inflation remains at the forefront of economic policy. With businesses navigating higher costs and uncertainty about interest rate cuts, the job market is likely to continue facing mixed signals in the coming months.\n- From our data we see that there has been a significant increase in the number of \u201cremoved jobs\u201d of around 103,000 from August to September. With inflation management still a top priority, there is hesitation about cutting interest rates too quickly, even though such a move could stimulate business growth.\n\n### U.S. Job Listings by Month \\| January 2020 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGjdolhTBvs2w/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729276888968?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hFjj4k2_EUH39I5Y51ubA7MeRs8d9qaEjfw4tRaJS6Q)\n\n* * *\n\n## LinkUp 10,000\n\nThe [LinkUp 10,000](https://www.linkup.com/data/10000) is an analytic published daily and monthly that captures the total U.S. job openings from the 10,000 global employers in LinkUp\u2019s jobs dataset with the most U.S. openings.\n\nIn September, the job market experienced a slight dip in momentum, with the monthly LinkUp 10,000 index falling by 1.0% compared to the previous month. The current monthly job listings stand at 4,783,299, down from 4,829,875 in August. This drop follows a similar trend of cautious hiring observed in the later half of the summer, suggesting that businesses may be holding back amid broader economic uncertainties. However, despite this monthly decrease, the overall index is still 9.4% lower than this time last year, reflecting a sustained shift in the labor market.\n\nIn summary, September saw a continued contraction in job postings, marking a challenging environment despite isolated growth sectors.\n\n### Monthly LinkUp 10,000 \\| January 2021 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQH1mvMm77GT5A/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729276971615?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nLOnb0tDzj-_HWkGA7eQ_yuMnIYz4W7Ij31vYgdcG40)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By Industry (NAICS)\n\nWe're seeing an increase in open jobs across 30% of industries this month, with the largest gains observed in:\n\n- Retail (+41k)\n- Finance and Insurance (+39.4k)\n- Wholesale Trade (+14.5k)\n\nIndustries that experienced the largest drops:\n\n- Public Administration (-60k)\n- Healthcare (-20.8k)\n- Education (-19.8k)\n\n### Job Listings by Industry (NAICS) \\| September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG0ByQrqzv-bw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277009565?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aM5tCyQa_eWBmFtbQ3EbzThW_z6-Bkg9pHThT056Sow)\n\n## Industry Spotlight:\n\n## Retail \u2013 General Merchandise\n\nThis sector experienced a notable 7% increase in job listings for September, likely driven by heightened consumer demand, strategic expansion efforts, and inflationary pressures shifting consumer behavior. As prices rise across the board, more shoppers are turning to budget-friendly options, like dollar stores, for essential goods. A prime example is Dollar General, which, despite facing weaker earnings, continues its aggressive real-estate expansion.\n\nWith over 20,000 locations in 48 states, Dollar General boosted hiring last year to enhance customer experience and added staff at self-checkout areas to mitigate retail theft. Similarly, Dollar Tree has opened more than 300 new stores this year and acquired 170 leases from the bankrupt 99 Cents Only Stores, reopening over 100 locations and planning an additional 50 by the end of 2024. Together, Dollar General and Dollar Tree are set to open over 1,300 new locations this fiscal year, outpacing other retailers and reflecting their confidence in growth through expansion.\n\n### Daily Job Listings: Rise in Number of Active jobs in September in the Dollar General\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG_pHuqgRFmNw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277053909?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=POqU_ig1kDqSUOToey_DJewLxPAM2q-Kq8x_OREivB8)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By Occupation (O\\*NET)\n\nIn step with the job postings across U.S. industries this month, 24% of occupational groups saw a rise in hiring.\n\nOccupations with a rise in demand:\n\n- Sales and Related (+37.1k)\n- Personal Care (+9.9k)\n- Computer and Mathematical (+8.4k)\n\nOccupations with a drop in demand:\n\n- Education Instruction and Library (-33.9k)\n- Healthcare Practitioners and technical (-14.6k)\n\n## Recommended by LinkedIn\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFynnru1I2NXw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1697128191400?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9-i4bJjOE5MudupxUOWe0h2j0lPKV3PbMtApGVUyAYk)\\\\\nQ4 Newsletter\\\\\n\\\\\nSoni\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/q4-newsletter-soni-resources-group)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQF79DEJ-Py2Ww/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1675948243714?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WbUMMyr2F58g9vpj9E0UgahbITS0GJ1COPNNHFPKjsg)\\\\\nA Strengthening Job Market \u2013 January 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nRose International\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strengthening-job-market-january-2023-rose-international)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGnqH3Ln7azFA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1681365338659?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Zij85VwasnlH5ZIADki37JBciP2eQ36Z2XuOPryyT8A)\\\\\nAn Expanding Job Market \u2013 March 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nRose International\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/expanding-job-market-march-2023-rose-international)\n\n### Job Listings by Occupation (O\\*NET) \\| September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFgPn72kh1LlA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277074883?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WcQikZYCl3ALo6pgeyEr47ralwt-K9y1thp-z-jXqGU)\n\n## Occupation Spotlight:\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Art/Design/Entertainment/Media occupations saw a 9% drop in job listings, reflecting the industry's ongoing challenges. This decline could be attributed to shifts in consumer habits, reduced spending on non-essential goods, and growing automation in creative roles. A notable example is Warner Music Group (WMG), which recently announced 750 layoffs as part of a restructuring effort. The company is aiming to streamline its recorded music business by cutting 13% of its workforce, with most of the layoffs affecting corporate and support roles. While traditional creative jobs are shrinking, there\u2019s a noticeable rise in AI-related roles, as entertainment companies like WMG increasingly look to technology to reshape the future of media.\n\n### Warner Music Group Software Developer hires spike in Q2, Q3\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEF1nxy5bh4ug/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277128080?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=lIcJuD2IDZdYLaaVCnAN6YVtOgrStvDIvesDzCU_080)\n\n### WMG Active Jobs requiring Artificial Intelligence skill since 1/1/23\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHeqy3IRi6jCg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277143940?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hxErdvhSmGMTEYG5lVvhInshluJuLUV8sHCUtYX7d44)\n\n## Computer and Mathematical\n\nComputer and Mathematical job listings saw a modest 3.2% increase reflecting a cautious but steady uptick in hiring. Companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Meta have all shown slight improvements in their job postings. However, one notable exception is Microsoft, which seems to be lagging in this department, showing either stagnant or reduced hiring trends. The overall trend suggests that, while the tech industry is slowly recovering from earlier slowdowns, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Some companies are clearly ramping up their technical talent, while others, like Microsoft, may be taking a more conservative approach.\n\n### Computer and Mathematical roles Active Job Listings in Magnificent seven companies in September\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEYkcy2rnp3jg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277190829?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=QSP17IIcihXu6J8_r4xm2JKPDCbHanMbC06L4wOBDGU)\n\n* * *\n\n## Closed Duration\n\nClosed duration, or the average number of days job listings are posted on company websites before they are removed, tracks hiring velocity across the entire U.S. economy.

This decline follows a trend of cautious hiring, reflecting companies' concerns about ongoing inflation and market volatility. While the broader job market remains resilient, this reduction in job postings suggests that businesses are adopting a wait-and-see approach, particularly in industries sensitive to economic conditions.\n- Looking Ahead: The tension between fostering job creation and managing inflation remains at the forefront of economic policy. With businesses navigating higher costs and uncertainty about interest rate cuts, the job market is likely to continue facing mixed signals in the coming months.\n- From our data we see that there has been a significant increase in the number of \u201cremoved jobs\u201d of around 103,000 from August to September. With inflation management still a top priority, there is hesitation about cutting interest rates too quickly, even though such a move could stimulate business growth.\n\n### U.S. Job Listings by Month \\| January 2020 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGjdolhTBvs2w/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729276888968?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hFjj4k2_EUH39I5Y51ubA7MeRs8d9qaEjfw4tRaJS6Q)\n\n* * *\n\n## LinkUp 10,000\n\nThe [LinkUp 10,000](https://www.linkup.com/data/10000?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) is an analytic published daily and monthly that captures the total U.S. job openings from the 10,000 global employers in LinkUp\u2019s jobs dataset with the most U.S. openings.\n\nIn September, the job market experienced a slight dip in momentum, with the monthly LinkUp 10,000 index falling by 1.0% compared to the previous month. The current monthly job listings stand at 4,783,299, down from 4,829,875 in August. This drop follows a similar trend of cautious hiring observed in the later half of the summer, suggesting that businesses may be holding back amid broader economic uncertainties. However, despite this monthly decrease, the overall index is still 9.4% lower than this time last year, reflecting a sustained shift in the labor market.\n\nIn summary, September saw a continued contraction in job postings, marking a challenging environment despite isolated growth sectors.\n\n### Monthly LinkUp 10,000 \\| January 2021 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQH1mvMm77GT5A/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729276971615?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nLOnb0tDzj-_HWkGA7eQ_yuMnIYz4W7Ij31vYgdcG40)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By Industry (NAICS)\n\nWe're seeing an increase in open jobs across 30% of industries this month, with the largest gains observed in:\n\n- Retail (+41k)\n- Finance and Insurance (+39.4k)\n- Wholesale Trade (+14.5k)\n\nIndustries that experienced the largest drops:\n\n- Public Administration (-60k)\n- Healthcare (-20.8k)\n- Education (-19.8k)\n\n### Job Listings by Industry (NAICS) \\| September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG0ByQrqzv-bw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277009565?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aM5tCyQa_eWBmFtbQ3EbzThW_z6-Bkg9pHThT056Sow)\n\n## Industry Spotlight:\n\n## Retail \u2013 General Merchandise\n\nThis sector experienced a notable 7% increase in job listings for September, likely driven by heightened consumer demand, strategic expansion efforts, and inflationary pressures shifting consumer behavior. As prices rise across the board, more shoppers are turning to budget-friendly options, like dollar stores, for essential goods. A prime example is Dollar General, which, despite facing weaker earnings, continues its aggressive real-estate expansion.\n\nWith over 20,000 locations in 48 states, Dollar General boosted hiring last year to enhance customer experience and added staff at self-checkout areas to mitigate retail theft. Similarly, Dollar Tree has opened more than 300 new stores this year and acquired 170 leases from the bankrupt 99 Cents Only Stores, reopening over 100 locations and planning an additional 50 by the end of 2024. Together, Dollar General and Dollar Tree are set to open over 1,300 new locations this fiscal year, outpacing other retailers and reflecting their confidence in growth through expansion.\n\n### Daily Job Listings: Rise in Number of Active jobs in September in the Dollar General\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG_pHuqgRFmNw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277053909?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=POqU_ig1kDqSUOToey_DJewLxPAM2q-Kq8x_OREivB8)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By Occupation (O\\*NET)\n\nIn step with the job postings across U.S. industries this month, 24% of occupational groups saw a rise in hiring.\n\nOccupations with a rise in demand:\n\n- Sales and Related (+37.1k)\n- Personal Care (+9.9k)\n- Computer and Mathematical (+8.4k)\n\nOccupations with a drop in demand:\n\n- Education Instruction and Library (-33.9k)\n- Healthcare Practitioners and technical (-14.6k)\n\n## Recommended by LinkedIn\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFynnru1I2NXw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1697128191400?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9-i4bJjOE5MudupxUOWe0h2j0lPKV3PbMtApGVUyAYk)\\\\\nQ4 Newsletter\\\\\n\\\\\nSoni\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/q4-newsletter-soni-resources-group)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQF79DEJ-Py2Ww/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1675948243714?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WbUMMyr2F58g9vpj9E0UgahbITS0GJ1COPNNHFPKjsg)\\\\\nA Strengthening Job Market \u2013 January 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nRose International\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strengthening-job-market-january-2023-rose-international)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGnqH3Ln7azFA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1681365338659?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Zij85VwasnlH5ZIADki37JBciP2eQ36Z2XuOPryyT8A)\\\\\nAn Expanding Job Market \u2013 March 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nRose International\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/expanding-job-market-march-2023-rose-international)\n\n### Job Listings by Occupation (O\\*NET) \\| September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFgPn72kh1LlA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277074883?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WcQikZYCl3ALo6pgeyEr47ralwt-K9y1thp-z-jXqGU)\n\n## Occupation Spotlight:\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Art/Design/Entertainment/Media occupations saw a 9% drop in job listings, reflecting the industry's ongoing challenges. This decline could be attributed to shifts in consumer habits, reduced spending on non-essential goods, and growing automation in creative roles. A notable example is Warner Music Group (WMG), which recently announced 750 layoffs as part of a restructuring effort. The company is aiming to streamline its recorded music business by cutting 13% of its workforce, with most of the layoffs affecting corporate and support roles. While traditional creative jobs are shrinking, there\u2019s a noticeable rise in AI-related roles, as entertainment companies like WMG increasingly look to technology to reshape the future of media.\n\n### Warner Music Group Software Developer hires spike in Q2, Q3\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEF1nxy5bh4ug/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277128080?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=lIcJuD2IDZdYLaaVCnAN6YVtOgrStvDIvesDzCU_080)\n\n### WMG Active Jobs requiring Artificial Intelligence skill since 1/1/23\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHeqy3IRi6jCg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277143940?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hxErdvhSmGMTEYG5lVvhInshluJuLUV8sHCUtYX7d44)\n\n## Computer and Mathematical\n\nComputer and Mathematical job listings saw a modest 3.2% increase reflecting a cautious but steady uptick in hiring. Companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Meta have all shown slight improvements in their job postings. However, one notable exception is Microsoft, which seems to be lagging in this department, showing either stagnant or reduced hiring trends. The overall trend suggests that, while the tech industry is slowly recovering from earlier slowdowns, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Some companies are clearly ramping up their technical talent, while others, like Microsoft, may be taking a more conservative approach.\n\n### Computer and Mathematical roles Active Job Listings in Magnificent seven companies in September\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEYkcy2rnp3jg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277190829?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=QSP17IIcihXu6J8_r4xm2JKPDCbHanMbC06L4wOBDGU)\n\n* * *\n\n## Closed Duration\n\nClosed duration, or the average number of days job listings are posted on company websites before they are removed, tracks hiring velocity across the entire U.S. economy. As the average number of days a job listing remains live increases, hiring velocity slows.\n\nThe closed duration increased in September, rising by 5.5 days from August's figure to a total of 46 days.\n\n### Closed Duration of U.S. Jobs \\| January 2020 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQF0dccOJ4ySOg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277217374?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ih-gtwMxWhpFjAxonNX9HtE6X2vkmyRMcFzdkHjI76k)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By State\n\nDuring the month of September, 25% of the United States saw an increase in job listings.

Add in the exponential growth of [AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence) and automation, and it's no surprise the tech job market has been roiled over the past few years.\n\nAs technology advances and companies attempt to keep pace amid constant volatility, it begs the question: Will the uncertainty of the tech job market -- slow job growth, continuous layoffs and skill shortages -- continue into 2025?\n\nHere are some statistics that clarify the tech job market in 2025.\n\n## 1\\. Tech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow at twice the rate of the overall workforce in the next decade\n\nTech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow much faster than average, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association's (CompTIA) 2024 \" [State of the Tech Workforce](https://www.comptia.org/content/research/state-of-the-tech-workforce)\" report. The report projected tech job growth from 6 million in 2024 to 7.1 million in 2034.\n\nAccording to research from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/), computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than average from 2023 to 2033, with a projected 356,700 job openings annually.\n\n## 2\\. More than 90% of organizations worldwide will be affected by the IT skills shortage by 2026\n\nBy 2026, the IT skills shortage will become a significant problem for most organizations globally, resulting in $5.5 trillion in losses, according to an IDC [survey](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52128824) of North American IT leaders. Organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry [predicted](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/talent-crunch-future-of-work) the skills shortage might leave as many as 85 million unfilled tech-related jobs by 2030.\n\nThe IT skills shortage may already be here. No longer a looming issue, AI and other technologies continue to advance faster than workers and organizations can react. Staffing firm [Robert Half](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/building-tech-teams) reported that 95% of tech leaders who responded to its survey currently face challenges finding skilled workers.\n\n## 3\\. 48% of tech organizations are prioritizing upskilling and cross-skilling over new hires\n\n[The Linux Foundation](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/2023-state-of-tech-talent-report-acquiring-and-retaining-technical-talent-in-2023-kh-0) reported that a growing number of organizations, in response to technological advances and a tough labor market, are investing internally to close skill gaps rather than hiring new talent or consultants.\n\nOrganizations continue to prioritize [upskilling](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/upskilling), [reskilling](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/definition/reskilling) and cross-skilling to meet their needs. After all, the half-life of technology skills is as short as 2.5 years, according to [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2023/09/reskilling-in-the-age-of-ai). The World Economic Forum, back in October 2020, [noted](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/) that more than half of workers require skilling of some type by 2025 due to rapid technology advancements.\n\n## 4\\. Python is the most in-demand programming language\n\nAccording to Indeed's \"Tapping Into Today's Tech Talent\" [report](https://www.indeed.com/lead/tapping-into-todays-tech-talent) from October 2024, [Python](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Python) is the most in-demand skill in job listings, followed by experience with [AWS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/definition/Amazon-Web-Services), which enjoyed the largest growth in demand in the last year, as well as Oracle, Java and JavaScript.\n\n[PyTorch](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/PyTorch), Rust, [TensorFlow](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/TensorFlow), Flutter and Dart were listed as other fast-growing areas. Xamarin, Erlang, Azure and iOS faced the biggest declines in demand, according to the report, with Erlang among the list of [dying programming languages](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/5-dead-programming-languages-we-should-never-forget).\n\n## 5\\. The worldwide average salary for IT professionals is $88,448\n\n[Skillsoft's \"2024-25 IT Skills and Salary Report\"](https://cdn.bfldr.com/SDYPVW60/at/vfhxpgf7bh3qnc8bhnj9wk7/Skillsoft_IT_Skills_Salary_Report_2024.pdf) stated the average worldwide salary for IT professionals has increased nearly 5% since last year. North America recorded the highest average salary of $113,211 in comparison to three other regions: Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia-Pacific.\n\n[C-level](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/C-level) IT executives earned the highest salaries, according to the report, followed by IT architecture and design, and then cloud computing. In North America, the highest salaries are in the IT software sector. Meanwhile, IT professionals in the education sector reported the lowest average salary.\n\n## 6\\. LinkedIn job listings referencing AI have more than doubled worldwide from 2021 to 2023\n\nLinkedIn's November 2023 \"Future of Work Report: AI at Work\" [highlighted](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/economicgraph/en-us/PDF/future-of-work-report-ai-november-2023.pdf) the ever-increasing demand for AI skills as organizations integrate AI into their business practices. Other hiring platforms concur. [Indeed's Hiring Lab](https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/03/14/march-2024-us-labor-market-update/) reported a 30-fold increase in [generative AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI)-related jobs from January 2023 to February 2024, though they still make up a relatively small part of total jobs.\n\nThat is changing as organizations focus on [AI skills entering 2025](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/9-top-AI-and-machine-learning-trends). A [ResumeTemplates.com survey](https://www.resumetemplates.com/4-in-10-companies-will-replace-workers-with-ai-in-2025/) found that 87% of leaders who plan to hire list AI experience as valuable for job seekers. Plus, AI skills benefit current employees. For example, in its [2025 salary guide](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/salary-guide/technology), Robert Half reported that 44% of organizations boost pay for workers with AI and [machine learning](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML) skills.\n\n## 7\\. Nontech industries hired more tech talent workers than the tech industry in 2023\n\nCBRE, a commercial real estate services and investment firm, found tech industry hiring is slowing. Nontech industries hire more tech talent than tech industries, a first in the CBRE \"[Scoring Tech Talent\" report](https://www.cbre.com/insights/books/scoring-tech-talent-2024)'s 11-year history.\n\nWhile the tech industry added nearly 29,000 tech talent jobs in 2023, the report noted professional and business services, excluding tech, netted almost 50,000 jobs, followed by roughly 45,000 in the transportation, warehousing and wholesale sectors.\n\n## 8\\. More than 225,000 tech employees have been laid off in 2024\n\nLayoffs, rampant in the tech industry since the pandemic, aren't stopping. [TrueUp's layoff tracker](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs) reported more than 1,000 rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting nearly 700 people per day.\n\nContinuous layoffs parallel an uptick in unemployment for tech workers. According to [CompTIA's \"Tech Jobs Report\"](https://www.comptia.org/content/tech-jobs-report), in June 2024, unemployment for IT professionals reached 3.7%, the highest mark since August 2020.\n\n## 9\\. 56% of tech managers are loosening experience requirements to speed the hiring process\n\nTo combat hiring challenges, organizations are deprioritizing experience to help find and hire tech talent faster, according to Robert Half's 2025 salary guide. Additionally, the salary guide found technology leaders are taking other measures to attract top candidates, including 45% of leaders who've decided to increase pay.\n\n_Alison Roller is a freelance

The company ended the first quarter with almost 70,800 employees, up 2% from the prior quarter.\n\nIn 2023, dubbed by co-founder Mark Zuckerberg as a so-called 'Year of Efficiency,' Meta cut a third of its workforce. Since 2022, the company and others like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have cut at least 440,000 employees. Meta terminated 21,000 positions alone in 2023, according to previous reporting by CoStar News.\n\nAs part of its office consolidation, Meta listed 133,000 square feet for sublease last year at 12105 W. Waterfront Drive in Playa Vista, California, as well as 434,000 square feet at 181 Fremont St.  in San Francisco after a round of 11,000 job cuts.\n\n# AI Expenses\n\nMeta pointed to lower restructuring costs in the second quarter \u2014 including office closings, severance and personnel costs, and other related expenses \u2014 as a driver of declining expenses, helping to partially offset the firm's most expensive category during the quarter of research and development. Costs in the category rose 13%, driven in part by infrastructure costs.\n\nThe firm isn't likely to back down from those R&D expenses through the rest of the year as it continues to invest in its artificial intelligence technology, and the real estate infrastructure to accommodate that growth.\n\nThe company expects its 2024 capital expenditures to range between $37 billion to $40 billion, up slightly from its prior expected range of $35 billion to $40 billion.\n\n\"While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts,\" Li said.\n\nLarge technology companies have been pouring billions of dollars into data centers to capitalize on the generative AI boom, even as they cut millions of square feet in office space.\n\nIn its second quarter earnings released on Wednesday, Microsoft said it spent $19 billion on projects to expand its Azure public cloud unit and AI products in the quarter that ended June 30, up from $10.7 billion for the same time a year earlier. Google parent Alphabet reported last week that it spent $13 billion in the second quarter to build data centers and other AI infrastructure.\n\n\"The big theme right now is, of course, AI,\" Zuckerberg said during the earnings call. \"The engine that powers all these new \\[AI\\] experiences is the Llama family of foundation models. In this quarter we released Llama 3.1 which includes the first frontier level open source model as well as new and industry leading small and medium-sized models.\"\n\nMeta executives didn't disclose its hiring goals for next year to meet demand from its ramped up AI investments, but Li said the company expects to \"primarily target our hiring to focus on priority areas, and we will be running a very disciplined headcount process.\"\n\n**Follow us on Social Media**\n\n**Have feedback or questions?

As the economy slowly shifts and technology rapidly evolves, change is unavoidable, but it doesn\u2019t need to be another hiring obstacle. In 2024, the companies who persevere will be the ones who don\u2019t fear shifts but embrace them.\n\nTo build and retain winning teams, leaders must stay on top of the latest talent acquisition trends. The hiring landscape is ever-evolving, along with the strategies, values, and expectations of the workforce. In response, businesses everywhere are rethinking who to hire, where work is done, and how to achieve their goals.\n\nWhether recruiting for creative, marketing or tech teams this year \u2013 if you hope to achieve success, these are the 2024 hiring trends and market shifts you can\u2019t ignore.\n\n1.

[The contingent staffing surge continues.](#Hiring Trend 7)\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#1: The job market is tight. The talent market is tighter.**\n\nDespite slowing economic growth, 85% of hiring managers indicate their companies are likely to hire talent this year, based on the data obtained from our 2024 Hiring Trends survey. In addition, over 40% admit their teams are currently understaffed, listing employee turnover as the top reason for new jobs opening.\n\nThe [latest US jobs report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) supports our findings, showing there are currently more jobs open than talent available for hire. While recent headcount reductions introduced a wave of new candidates into the market, skilled professionals quickly found new opportunities, and job-switching remains at [a historical high](https://www.hiringlab.org/2023/11/15/indeeds-2024-us-jobs-hiring-trends-report/) across industries. Our recent poll of 1,000+ LinkedIn users revealed that 76% of candidates plan to switch jobs or companies in 2024.\n\nTo step ahead of the competition, attract top talent, and improve retention \u2013 leaders are making a strategic effort to be more empathetic toward their employees and prospective hires. Companies everywhere are revising their compensation packages, expanding their benefits offerings, and updating their hiring processes with job candidate preferences at heart.\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#2: Hybrid is the next normal.**\n\nOur 2024 Hiring Trends survey also demonstrated that today\u2019s employees value flexibility and autonomy more than ever before. 90% of job seeker respondents indicated they would leave on-site jobs for remote opportunities. After experiencing [the dual benefits of relaxed work-from-home policies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2020/02/12/top-5-benefits-of-remote-work-for-companies/?sh=4a917d1616c8), many individual contributors and managers alike are reluctant to return to the office.\n\nAt the same time, business leaders are increasingly in favor of in-person work, with more than 2 out of 3 hiring managers unveiling plans to return to the office at least for part of the time in 2024. In light of recent world events and economic developments, there\u2019s a renewed focus on workplace productivity across industries, and remote work\u2019s impact on employee performance remains a subject of debate.\n\nAs companies carefully balance their growth goals with job seeker expectations, 60% of hiring managers say that hybrid work will be the most common arrangement of 2024. In [the words of Francine Katsoudas](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2023/m10/a-magnet-not-a-mandate-chuck-robbins-on-office-transformation.html#:~:text=Today's%20workers%20demand%20flexibility.,but%20not%20every%20day!).), Chief People, Policy & Purpose Officer of Cisco, _\u201cThe office should be a magnet, not a mandate.\u201d_\n\n[![request local talent](http://www.onwardsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/request-local-talent-button-300x59.png)](https://www.onwardsearch.com/request-talent/?utm_source=2024+Hiring+Trends&utm_medium=blog&utm_id=2024hiringtrendsblog)\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#3: Pay transparency laws are changing.**\n\nBeyond flexibility, today\u2019s talent demand transparency. As of the start of 2024, eight US states and a growing number of cities have implemented [pay disclosure laws](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/04/is-pay-transparency-good-for-business-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-in-2023/). Last year also saw [a new bill](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/national-pay-transparency-bill-proposed/) introduced to congress that could require employers in all states to disclose pay ranges, if passed. This year, US pay transparency laws and company policies are expected to multiply, and hiring managers are increasingly disclosing pay upfront on their own accord.\n\nPay disclosure is not yet a nation-wide legal mandate in the US, but it is a competitive advantage for companies across states. 99% of creative, marketing and tech professionals responded they would be more likely to apply to companies that embrace pay transparency when asked in our 2024 Hiring Trends survey. The survey also found that 1 in 3 professionals still value compensation above all else.\n\nWhile job seekers have much to consider in 2024, salaries remain among the top reasons that organizations win and lose great hires. As recent pay transparency trends place a renewed focus on wages, companies everywhere are leveraging resources like [our 2024 Salary Guide](https://www.onwardsearch.com/salary-guide-2023/) to craft equitable and competitive pay ranges.\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#4: DEI is now DEIA.**\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) continues to be a focus for job seekers and hiring managers alike. Recent studies revealed that [75% of HR leaders](https://www.ey.com/en_ro/news/2023/09/ey-study-workers-feel-a-sense-of-belonging-at-their-workplaces) say their company will prioritize diversity hiring in 2024, while [85% of professionals](https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/boost-accessibility-in-2024-digital-accessibility-strategies-for-success-no-matter-where-youre-starting/) consider digital accessibility a competitive advantage for their organization.\n\nAlthough \u201cDEI\u201d remains [the most common acronym](https://powertofly.com/up/diversity-and-inclusion-acronyms#:~:text=With%20over%202.5%20billion%20results,9%20million%20search%20results%20respectively.) used for corporate inclusion programs in the US, there\u2019s recently been a push to add an \u201cA\u201d for \u201caccessibility\u201d and turn \u201cDEI\u201d to \u201cDEIA.\u201d Accessibility and inclusive design are growing priorities for HR departments looking to improve their hiring processes and accommodate people with disabilities. In addition \u2013 marketing, product and design teams are increasingly hiring digital accessibility experts to make their experiences accessible for all.\n\nWhile the one billion people with disabilities provide companies with more than enough reasons to invest in accessibility, the [recent uptick in ADA lawsuits](https://www.onwardsearch.com/digital-accessibility-advocacy-guide/) has undoubtedly contributed to the rise in awareness. Resources like our newly released [Digital Accessibility Advocacy Guide](https://www.onwardsearch.com/digital-accessibility-advocacy-guide/) can help professionals advocate for A11Y initiatives within their organizations. To paraphrase the words of [Level Access](https://www.levelaccess.com/), _there is no \u201cD,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d or \u201cI\u201d without \u201cA.\u201d_\n\n[![download the accessibility advocacy guide ](http://www.onwardsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Download-the-Accessibility-Advocacy-Guide-1024x100.png)](https://www.onwardsearch.com/digital-accessibility-advocacy-guide/?utm_source=2024+Hiring+Trends&utm_medium=blog&utm_id=2024hiringtrendsblog)\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#5: Emerging tech roles are on the rise.**\n\nDigital accessibility isn\u2019t the only area of expertise in increasingly high demand. Over 50% of companies plan to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) this year, and AI advancements are predicted to result in [97 million new jobs](https://allwork.space/2021/11/ai-will-create-97-million-jobs-but-workers-dont-have-the-skills-required-yet/) by 2025. From Chief AI Officers to AI Prompt Engineers, [new AI roles](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/12/10-in-demand-ai-jobs-2024/) have already emerged, and the demand for these experts is expected to grow through 2024.\n\nWidely regarded as [today\u2019s most talked about innovation](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/06/human-creativity-vs-artificial-intelligence/), AI stole the spotlight from Web3 and extended reality (XR) technologies in 2023, but it is also pushing them forward in 2024. Among its countless capabilities, AI has the potential to accelerate blockchain and [metaverse development](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2022/10/10-most-in-demand-metaverse-hires/). We recently polled over 200 professionals on the value of virtual reality (VR) worlds today, and over 70% agreed that brands should invest in immersive experiences.\n\nEmerging technologies have already advanced at an unprecedented rate in recent months, and specialists predict that 2024 will bring more technological advancements than many creatives, marketers and even tech experts could imagine. Businesses everywhere are competing to develop and master the latest AI tools, but a tool is only as strong as the talent behind it, and new innovations call for new hires.\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#6: AI is changing how we find talent and jobs.**\n\nIn 2024, the rise of AI is transforming the way companies hire and how professionals apply. [New AI recruitment tools](https://www.unite.ai/ai-recruiting-tools/) seem to emerge every day, and over 80% of our 2024 Hiring Trends survey respondents have stated their teams are already using AI, [investing in training](https://www.onwardsearch.com/generative-ai-training/), or looking into adoption.\n\nInnovative companies are leveraging algorithms for everything [from resume filtering to employee turnover prediction](https://www.ssonetwork.com/intelligent-automation/articles/beginners-guide-to-generative-ai-in-recruiting). Generative AI tools draft job descriptions, advanced chatbots answer candidate questions in real time, and automated candidate recommendations eliminate hiring bias. At the same time, job seekers are leveraging AI to update their resumes, search for jobs, draft cover letters and more.\n\nWhen used properly, AI\u2019s possibilities are seemingly endless for talent, recruiters, and hiring managers alike. As new hiring tools, widgets and plug-ins emerge, the teams that adapt will be the ones to thrive.\n\n[![request ai experts](http://www.onwardsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ai-experts-button-300x59.png)](https://www.onwardsearch.com/request-talent/?utm_source=2024+Hiring+Trends&utm_medium=blog&utm_id=2024hiringtrendsblog)\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#7: [The contingent staffing surge](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/02/the-contingent-staffing-surge-of-2023-why-on-demand-talent-is-in-demand/) continues.**\n\nEntering 2024, companies are racing to upskill their teams while doubling down on cost-saving strategies. As a result, the gig economy\u2019s growth shows no signs of slowing down. From freelance talent to contract consultants and fractional executives, leaders continue to rely upon cost-effective talent solutions to elevate their teams.\n\n[80% of companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/hr-statistics-trends/) say they\u2019re leveraging contingent workers for hard-to-fill roles in 2024, while over 60% of professionals say they would consider freelance or contract work. The nature of contingent labor gives businesses the capacity to scale their workforce up or down to meet changing needs. At the same time, contract work provides professionals with the ability to choose the projects that best suit their interests and availability.\n\nThe [freelance revolution](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/02/the-contingent-staffing-surge-of-2023-why-on-demand-talent-is-in-demand/) has been steadily building for some time. Recent market shifts only amplified the surge. As 2024 goes into full swing, companies must evaluate if contingent talent solutions are right for their organizations, consider their staffing partner options, and adapt their hiring strategies to our new reality.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Hit your 2024 hiring goals.**\n\nOnward Search specializes in staffing and talent solutions at the intersection of creative and technology.

This decline follows a trend of cautious hiring, reflecting companies' concerns about ongoing inflation and market volatility. While the broader job market remains resilient, this reduction in job postings suggests that businesses are adopting a wait-and-see approach, particularly in industries sensitive to economic conditions.\n- Looking Ahead: The tension between fostering job creation and managing inflation remains at the forefront of economic policy. With businesses navigating higher costs and uncertainty about interest rate cuts, the job market is likely to continue facing mixed signals in the coming months.\n- From our data we see that there has been a significant increase in the number of \u201cremoved jobs\u201d of around 103,000 from August to September. With inflation management still a top priority, there is hesitation about cutting interest rates too quickly, even though such a move could stimulate business growth.\n\n### U.S. Job Listings by Month \\| January 2020 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGjdolhTBvs2w/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729276888968?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hFjj4k2_EUH39I5Y51ubA7MeRs8d9qaEjfw4tRaJS6Q)\n\n* * *\n\n## LinkUp 10,000\n\nThe [LinkUp 10,000](https://www.linkup.com/data/10000) is an analytic published daily and monthly that captures the total U.S. job openings from the 10,000 global employers in LinkUp\u2019s jobs dataset with the most U.S. openings.\n\nIn September, the job market experienced a slight dip in momentum, with the monthly LinkUp 10,000 index falling by 1.0% compared to the previous month. The current monthly job listings stand at 4,783,299, down from 4,829,875 in August. This drop follows a similar trend of cautious hiring observed in the later half of the summer, suggesting that businesses may be holding back amid broader economic uncertainties. However, despite this monthly decrease, the overall index is still 9.4% lower than this time last year, reflecting a sustained shift in the labor market.\n\nIn summary, September saw a continued contraction in job postings, marking a challenging environment despite isolated growth sectors.\n\n### Monthly LinkUp 10,000 \\| January 2021 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQH1mvMm77GT5A/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729276971615?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nLOnb0tDzj-_HWkGA7eQ_yuMnIYz4W7Ij31vYgdcG40)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By Industry (NAICS)\n\nWe're seeing an increase in open jobs across 30% of industries this month, with the largest gains observed in:\n\n- Retail (+41k)\n- Finance and Insurance (+39.4k)\n- Wholesale Trade (+14.5k)\n\nIndustries that experienced the largest drops:\n\n- Public Administration (-60k)\n- Healthcare (-20.8k)\n- Education (-19.8k)\n\n### Job Listings by Industry (NAICS) \\| September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG0ByQrqzv-bw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277009565?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aM5tCyQa_eWBmFtbQ3EbzThW_z6-Bkg9pHThT056Sow)\n\n## Industry Spotlight:\n\n## Retail \u2013 General Merchandise\n\nThis sector experienced a notable 7% increase in job listings for September, likely driven by heightened consumer demand, strategic expansion efforts, and inflationary pressures shifting consumer behavior. As prices rise across the board, more shoppers are turning to budget-friendly options, like dollar stores, for essential goods. A prime example is Dollar General, which, despite facing weaker earnings, continues its aggressive real-estate expansion.\n\nWith over 20,000 locations in 48 states, Dollar General boosted hiring last year to enhance customer experience and added staff at self-checkout areas to mitigate retail theft. Similarly, Dollar Tree has opened more than 300 new stores this year and acquired 170 leases from the bankrupt 99 Cents Only Stores, reopening over 100 locations and planning an additional 50 by the end of 2024. Together, Dollar General and Dollar Tree are set to open over 1,300 new locations this fiscal year, outpacing other retailers and reflecting their confidence in growth through expansion.\n\n### Daily Job Listings: Rise in Number of Active jobs in September in the Dollar General\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG_pHuqgRFmNw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277053909?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=POqU_ig1kDqSUOToey_DJewLxPAM2q-Kq8x_OREivB8)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By Occupation (O\\*NET)\n\nIn step with the job postings across U.S. industries this month, 24% of occupational groups saw a rise in hiring.\n\nOccupations with a rise in demand:\n\n- Sales and Related (+37.1k)\n- Personal Care (+9.9k)\n- Computer and Mathematical (+8.4k)\n\nOccupations with a drop in demand:\n\n- Education Instruction and Library (-33.9k)\n- Healthcare Practitioners and technical (-14.6k)\n\n## Recommended by LinkedIn\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFynnru1I2NXw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1697128191400?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9-i4bJjOE5MudupxUOWe0h2j0lPKV3PbMtApGVUyAYk)\\\\\nQ4 Newsletter\\\\\n\\\\\nSoni\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/q4-newsletter-soni-resources-group)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQF79DEJ-Py2Ww/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1675948243714?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WbUMMyr2F58g9vpj9E0UgahbITS0GJ1COPNNHFPKjsg)\\\\\nA Strengthening Job Market \u2013 January 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nRose International\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strengthening-job-market-january-2023-rose-international)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGnqH3Ln7azFA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1681365338659?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Zij85VwasnlH5ZIADki37JBciP2eQ36Z2XuOPryyT8A)\\\\\nAn Expanding Job Market \u2013 March 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nRose International\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/expanding-job-market-march-2023-rose-international)\n\n### Job Listings by Occupation (O\\*NET) \\| September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFgPn72kh1LlA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277074883?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WcQikZYCl3ALo6pgeyEr47ralwt-K9y1thp-z-jXqGU)\n\n## Occupation Spotlight:\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Art/Design/Entertainment/Media occupations saw a 9% drop in job listings, reflecting the industry's ongoing challenges. This decline could be attributed to shifts in consumer habits, reduced spending on non-essential goods, and growing automation in creative roles. A notable example is Warner Music Group (WMG), which recently announced 750 layoffs as part of a restructuring effort. The company is aiming to streamline its recorded music business by cutting 13% of its workforce, with most of the layoffs affecting corporate and support roles. While traditional creative jobs are shrinking, there\u2019s a noticeable rise in AI-related roles, as entertainment companies like WMG increasingly look to technology to reshape the future of media.\n\n### Warner Music Group Software Developer hires spike in Q2, Q3\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEF1nxy5bh4ug/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277128080?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=lIcJuD2IDZdYLaaVCnAN6YVtOgrStvDIvesDzCU_080)\n\n### WMG Active Jobs requiring Artificial Intelligence skill since 1/1/23\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHeqy3IRi6jCg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277143940?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hxErdvhSmGMTEYG5lVvhInshluJuLUV8sHCUtYX7d44)\n\n## Computer and Mathematical\n\nComputer and Mathematical job listings saw a modest 3.2% increase reflecting a cautious but steady uptick in hiring. Companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Meta have all shown slight improvements in their job postings. However, one notable exception is Microsoft, which seems to be lagging in this department, showing either stagnant or reduced hiring trends. The overall trend suggests that, while the tech industry is slowly recovering from earlier slowdowns, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing.

Business leaders everywhere are hopeful that the new year will bring new opportunities. Yet, the companies to truly thrive in 2025 will be the ones that were paying attention throughout 2024.\n\nTo build and retain winning teams, businesses need to consider what has changed and how to adapt. The hiring landscape is ever-evolving, along with talent strategies, values, and expectations. Each year is different. But recent trends offer a glimpse into what lies ahead.\n\nWhether your focus is creative, marketing, or technology \u2014 now is the time to review your lessons learned and ready your teams for tomorrow.\u00a0As we await the results of our [2025 Hiring Trends Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/survey-taken?sm=UgMRMjq_2BSP1LXwpHXlptqCWGIM_2BIET4lKP0WAvqHjgNSkZdOYIPmXh9nLHlOvjIJnHVSrvNe2Y8yin1YTapKWMXmjmpXO4BsL_2BWJd55qskqs1_2BKCy_2B68CzPTKgr2BmZehp07wjZQXvmFJAtdxuaycw_3D_3D), we reflect on the insights we gathered in 2024.\n\n* * *\n\n## 1) Job hunting wasn\u2019t easy.\u00a0Hiring wasn\u2019t easier.\n\nStanding out in a sea of job applicants is tough; finding the right applicant is even tougher. Leaders everywhere report hiring challenges continued through 2024. Common obstacles included budget constraints, difficulty identifying niche skills, and return-to-office opposition.\n\nAt the start of the year, [over 40% of employers](https://www.onwardsearch.com/salary-guide-2024/) admitted their teams were understaffed, with turnover being a leading cause of new openings. Today, that number is expected to be even higher. It is essential that companies act fast to prevent burnout, improve work-life balance, and hit their performance goals.\n\nIn 2025, leaders must continue to revise their compensation packages, adjust benefits offerings, and update processes with talent preferences at heart. These changes will be critical to winning and retaining top talent as hiring ramps up in Q1.\n\n> 40% of employers admitted their teams were understaffed.\n\n* * *\n\n## 2) Hybrid became the new normal.\n\nRemote work\u2019s impact on employee performance continued to be a subject of debate throughout the year, with business leaders in favor of in-person work and jobseekers adamantly against it. At the start of the year, [more than 2 out of 3 hiring managers](https://www.onwardsearch.com/salary-guide-2024/) unveiled plans to return to the office. The [employee outcry](https://fortune.com/article/rto-return-to-office-how-to-avoid-work-mandates-grocery-bill-inflation-prices/) was felt across companies.\n\nThroughout 2024, jobseekers showed they value flexibility and autonomy more than ever before. [90% of creative, marketing and technology professionals](https://www.onwardsearch.com/salary-guide-2024/) claimed they would leave on-site jobs for remote opportunities. After experiencing [the dual benefits of relaxed work-from-home policies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2020/02/12/top-5-benefits-of-remote-work-for-companies/?sh=4a917d1616c8), many remain reluctant to return to the office.\n\nAs companies carefully balanced their growth goals with job seeker expectations, [60% of hiring managers](https://www.onwardsearch.com/salary-guide-2024/) agreed that hybrid work would be the most common arrangement of 2024 \u2013 and it indeed became the most common practice. In [the words of Francine Katsoudas](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2023/m10/a-magnet-not-a-mandate-chuck-robbins-on-office-transformation.html#:~:text=Today%27s%20workers%20demand%20flexibility.,but%20not%20every%20day!).), Chief People, Policy & Purpose Officer of Cisco, \u201cThe office should be a magnet, not a mandate.\u201d\n\n> The office should be a magnet, not a mandate.\n\n* * *\n\n## 3) Pay transparency laws evolved.\n\nBeyond flexibility, today\u2019s talent demand transparency. In 2024, [US pay disclosure laws](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2024/02/pay-transparency/) and company policies multiplied, with hiring managers increasingly sharing salaries and ranges upfront on their own accord. As the year comes to a close, a growing number of US states and cities have now implemented such legislation.\n\nWhile the proposed [National Pay Transparency bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1599/text) has not yet been passed, it remains a competitive advantage for companies across states. When asked at the start of the year, [99% of creative, marketing and technology professionals](https://www.onwardsearch.com/content-resources/) said they would be more likely to apply to companies that embrace pay transparency. In addition, 1 in 3 professionals admitted they value compensation above all else.\n\nEvery year, job seekers have much to consider, but salaries remain among the top reasons that organizations win and lose great hires. As recent pay transparency trends place a renewed focus on wages, companies everywhere are leveraging [resources like our Salary Guides and surveys](https://www.onwardsearch.com/content-resources/) to craft equitable and competitive pay ranges.\n\n[![Take our 2025 Hiring Trends Survey Button](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHkL7clk1mibQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1732139908184?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=l06iyapfnOoZkkFSalmbCPktF1jOozk03kmBNXcK6rI)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2025-salary-trends)\n\n* * *\n\n## 4) DEI turned into DEIA.\n\nThroughout 2024, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has been a continued focus for job seekers and hiring managers alike. [75% of HR leaders](https://www.ey.com/en_ro/news/2023/09/ey-study-workers-feel-a-sense-of-belonging-at-their-workplaces) said their company prioritized diversity hiring in 2024, while many acknowledged the growing need for accessibility.\n\nAlthough \u201cDEI\u201d remains [the most common acronym](https://powertofly.com/up/diversity-and-inclusion-acronyms#:~:text=With%20over%202.5%20billion%20results,9%20million%20search%20results%20respectively.) used for corporate inclusion programs in the US, the push to add an \u201cA\u201d for \u201caccessibility\u201d made leaps forward, turning \u201cDEI\u201d to \u201cDEIA.\u201d Accessibility and inclusive design are growing priorities for HR departments looking to improve their hiring processes and accommodate people with disabilities. In addition \u2013 marketing, product and design teams are increasingly hiring digital accessibility experts to make their experiences accessible for all.\n\nWhile the one billion people with disabilities provide companies with more than enough reasons to invest in accessibility, the [continued uptick in ADA lawsuits](https://www.onwardsearch.com/digital-accessibility-advocacy-guide/) has undoubtedly contributed to the rise in awareness. Resources like our\u00a0[Digital Accessibility Advocacy Guide](https://www.onwardsearch.com/digital-accessibility-advocacy-guide/) can help professionals advocate for A11Y initiatives within their organizations. To paraphrase the words of [Level Access](https://www.levelaccess.com/), there is no \u201cD,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d or \u201cI\u201d without \u201cA.\u201d\n\n## Recommended by LinkedIn\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEFkH1tmSgCjw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1679602389261?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=dmfv2gdssdb-tP1Gsoq9QcrnLeTEoi5e2DZcTvRmsLQ)\\\\\nTop 5 Recruitment Trends for 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nBlue Signal Search\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-5-recruitment-trends-2023-blue-signal-search)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGvPPXLICFe1A/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1729701355926?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=a-Ffy60LpXGzZTeHiMIAebxY-IIkxgYXlPGZ2YlrApQ)\\\\\nTop Staffing Trends: Strategic Staffing Today\u2026\\\\\n\\\\\nSPECTRAFORCE\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n2 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-staffing-trends-strategic-today-stronger-teams-tomorrow-gb2zc)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQE11qEaS-djcQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1687370411695?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=8WetFM1Ew7ipgjLfWR8Q03ZI2Ka_dKTKo8KPwSR17SE)\\\\\nHow Businesses Can Hire Faster\\\\\n\\\\\nDan Schawbel\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-businesses-can-hire-faster-dan-schawbel)\n\n> There is no \u201cD,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d or \u201cI\u201d without \u201cA.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n## 5) Emerging tech roles emerged.\n\nDigital accessibility isn\u2019t the only area of expertise to grow in demand. From Chief AI Officers to AI Prompt Engineers, several new AI roles emerged, and the demand for these experts slowly grew. Companies everywhere invested in artificial intelligence (AI), and AI advancements\u00a0were\u00a0predicted to result in [97 million new jobs](https://allwork.space/2021/11/ai-will-create-97-million-jobs-but-workers-dont-have-the-skills-required-yet/) by the end of 2025.\n\nWidely regarded as [today\u2019s most talked about innovation](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/06/human-creativity-vs-artificial-intelligence/), AI stole the spotlight from Web3 and extended reality (XR) technologies, but it also pushed them forward in 2024. Among its countless capabilities, AI has the potential to accelerate blockchain and [metaverse development](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2022/10/10-most-in-demand-metaverse-hires/). We polled over 200 professionals on the value of virtual reality (VR) worlds, and over 70% agreed that companies should invest in immersive experiences.\n\nThe year was undoubtedly a step forward in an age of rapid technological advancement. And entering 2025, technologies will continue to evolve at an unprecedented rate, requiring companies to invest in new roles and skills to keep pace with innovation. Experts predict more ripple effects in the hiring market throughout the new year.\n\n> AI advancements\u00a0were\u00a0predicted to result in 97 million new jobs by the end of 2025.\n\n* * *\n\n## 6) AI changed how we find talent and jobs.\n\nThe rise of AI also transformed the way companies hire and how professionals apply. [New AI recruitment tools](https://www.unite.ai/ai-recruiting-tools/) seemed to emerge every day, and over 80% of our 2024 Hiring Trends survey respondents stated their teams used AI, [invested in training](https://www.onwardsearch.com/generative-ai-training/), or considered adoption.\n\nInnovative companies leverage algorithms for everything [from resume filtering to employee turnover prediction](https://www.ssonetwork.com/intelligent-automation/articles/beginners-guide-to-generative-ai-in-recruiting). Generative AI tools draft job descriptions, advanced chatbots answer candidate questions in real time, and automated candidate recommendations eliminate hiring bias. At the same time, job seekers are leveraging AI to update their resumes, search for jobs, draft cover letters and more.\n\nWhen used properly, AI\u2019s possibilities are seemingly endless for talent, recruiters, and hiring managers alike. Entering 2025, technology continues to advance. As new hiring tools, widgets and plug-ins emerge, the teams that adapt will thrive.\n\n[![Attend a Free GenAI Webinar Button](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHCESGkqXOgCA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1732139830691?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Az1YaknVZ2s_XOUjgmZGPDO4RKxbIOnpjpU0bnX1TZo)](https://onwardsearch.zoom.us/webinar/register/2117320253515/WN_AZte59EKSqioCZhdUvKM3Q)\n\n* * *\n\n## 7) Companies embraced hiring alternatives\n\nIn 2024, companies raced to upskill their teams while doubling down on [cost-saving initiatives](https://www.onwardsearch.com/hiring-on-a-budget-resource/). As a result, organizations became increasingly dependent on alternative hiring strategies. From freelance talent to contract consultants and fractional executives, leaders continue to rely upon cost-effective solutions to elevate their teams.\n\n[80% of companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/hr-statistics-trends/) said they leveraged contingent workers for hard-to-fill roles in 2024. The nature of contingent labor continues to give businesses the capacity to scale their workforce up or down to meet changing needs. At the same time, contract work provides professionals with the ability to choose the projects that best suit their interests and availability.\n\nThe [freelance revolution](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/02/the-contingent-staffing-surge-of-2023-why-on-demand-talent-is-in-demand/) had been steadily building for some time. Over the last few years, market shifts only amplified the surge, and the trend is expected to persist throughout the coming year. As we enter 2025, companies must evaluate which talent solutions are right for their organizations and adapt hiring strategies to our new reality.\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHpWEMIHyfcrA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1732134076626?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=UX7F8VN9wSr_IqkllvKjeJCQ-rXcolx3bHCLRW--N2g)The insights in this article were originally published on the Onward Search website.\n\n* * *\n\n[![2025 Salary & Market Trends Survey](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFLkAo5fXNhTQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1732136831928?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=YvvscPnSHm4Kc05-dY8DUa-emD7NzvxegZSLL_vVTkg)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2025-salary-trends)\n\nIn 2025, many hiring trends will continue, and new ones will emerge.

Add in the exponential growth of [AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence) and automation, and it's no surprise the tech job market has been roiled over the past few years.\n\nAs technology advances and companies attempt to keep pace amid constant volatility, it begs the question: Will the uncertainty of the tech job market -- slow job growth, continuous layoffs and skill shortages -- continue into 2025?\n\nHere are some statistics that clarify the tech job market in 2025.\n\n## 1\\. Tech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow at twice the rate of the overall workforce in the next decade\n\nTech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow much faster than average, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association's (CompTIA) 2024 \" [State of the Tech Workforce](https://www.comptia.org/content/research/state-of-the-tech-workforce)\" report. The report projected tech job growth from 6 million in 2024 to 7.1 million in 2034.\n\nAccording to research from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/), computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than average from 2023 to 2033, with a projected 356,700 job openings annually.\n\n## 2\\. More than 90% of organizations worldwide will be affected by the IT skills shortage by 2026\n\nBy 2026, the IT skills shortage will become a significant problem for most organizations globally, resulting in $5.5 trillion in losses, according to an IDC [survey](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52128824) of North American IT leaders. Organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry [predicted](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/talent-crunch-future-of-work) the skills shortage might leave as many as 85 million unfilled tech-related jobs by 2030.\n\nThe IT skills shortage may already be here. No longer a looming issue, AI and other technologies continue to advance faster than workers and organizations can react. Staffing firm [Robert Half](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/building-tech-teams) reported that 95% of tech leaders who responded to its survey currently face challenges finding skilled workers.\n\n## 3\\. 48% of tech organizations are prioritizing upskilling and cross-skilling over new hires\n\n[The Linux Foundation](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/2023-state-of-tech-talent-report-acquiring-and-retaining-technical-talent-in-2023-kh-0) reported that a growing number of organizations, in response to technological advances and a tough labor market, are investing internally to close skill gaps rather than hiring new talent or consultants.\n\nOrganizations continue to prioritize [upskilling](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/upskilling), [reskilling](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/definition/reskilling) and cross-skilling to meet their needs. After all, the half-life of technology skills is as short as 2.5 years, according to [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2023/09/reskilling-in-the-age-of-ai). The World Economic Forum, back in October 2020, [noted](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/) that more than half of workers require skilling of some type by 2025 due to rapid technology advancements.\n\n## 4\\. Python is the most in-demand programming language\n\nAccording to Indeed's \"Tapping Into Today's Tech Talent\" [report](https://www.indeed.com/lead/tapping-into-todays-tech-talent) from October 2024, [Python](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Python) is the most in-demand skill in job listings, followed by experience with [AWS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/definition/Amazon-Web-Services), which enjoyed the largest growth in demand in the last year, as well as Oracle, Java and JavaScript.\n\n[PyTorch](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/PyTorch), Rust, [TensorFlow](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/TensorFlow), Flutter and Dart were listed as other fast-growing areas. Xamarin, Erlang, Azure and iOS faced the biggest declines in demand, according to the report, with Erlang among the list of [dying programming languages](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/5-dead-programming-languages-we-should-never-forget).\n\n## 5\\. The worldwide average salary for IT professionals is $88,448\n\n[Skillsoft's \"2024-25 IT Skills and Salary Report\"](https://cdn.bfldr.com/SDYPVW60/at/vfhxpgf7bh3qnc8bhnj9wk7/Skillsoft_IT_Skills_Salary_Report_2024.pdf) stated the average worldwide salary for IT professionals has increased nearly 5% since last year. North America recorded the highest average salary of $113,211 in comparison to three other regions: Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia-Pacific.\n\n[C-level](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/C-level) IT executives earned the highest salaries, according to the report, followed by IT architecture and design, and then cloud computing. In North America, the highest salaries are in the IT software sector. Meanwhile, IT professionals in the education sector reported the lowest average salary.\n\n## 6\\. LinkedIn job listings referencing AI have more than doubled worldwide from 2021 to 2023\n\nLinkedIn's November 2023 \"Future of Work Report: AI at Work\" [highlighted](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/economicgraph/en-us/PDF/future-of-work-report-ai-november-2023.pdf) the ever-increasing demand for AI skills as organizations integrate AI into their business practices. Other hiring platforms concur. [Indeed's Hiring Lab](https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/03/14/march-2024-us-labor-market-update/) reported a 30-fold increase in [generative AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI)-related jobs from January 2023 to February 2024, though they still make up a relatively small part of total jobs.\n\nThat is changing as organizations focus on [AI skills entering 2025](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/9-top-AI-and-machine-learning-trends). A [ResumeTemplates.com survey](https://www.resumetemplates.com/4-in-10-companies-will-replace-workers-with-ai-in-2025/) found that 87% of leaders who plan to hire list AI experience as valuable for job seekers. Plus, AI skills benefit current employees. For example, in its [2025 salary guide](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/salary-guide/technology), Robert Half reported that 44% of organizations boost pay for workers with AI and [machine learning](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML) skills.\n\n## 7\\. Nontech industries hired more tech talent workers than the tech industry in 2023\n\nCBRE, a commercial real estate services and investment firm, found tech industry hiring is slowing. Nontech industries hire more tech talent than tech industries, a first in the CBRE \"[Scoring Tech Talent\" report](https://www.cbre.com/insights/books/scoring-tech-talent-2024)'s 11-year history.\n\nWhile the tech industry added nearly 29,000 tech talent jobs in 2023, the report noted professional and business services, excluding tech, netted almost 50,000 jobs, followed by roughly 45,000 in the transportation, warehousing and wholesale sectors.\n\n## 8\\. More than 225,000 tech employees have been laid off in 2024\n\nLayoffs, rampant in the tech industry since the pandemic, aren't stopping. [TrueUp's layoff tracker](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs) reported more than 1,000 rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting nearly 700 people per day.\n\nContinuous layoffs parallel an uptick in unemployment for tech workers. According to [CompTIA's \"Tech Jobs Report\"](https://www.comptia.org/content/tech-jobs-report), in June 2024, unemployment for IT professionals reached 3.7%, the highest mark since August 2020.\n\n## 9\\. 56% of tech managers are loosening experience requirements to speed the hiring process\n\nTo combat hiring challenges, organizations are deprioritizing experience to help find and hire tech talent faster, according to Robert Half's 2025 salary guide. Additionally, the salary guide found technology leaders are taking other measures to attract top candidates, including 45% of leaders who've decided to increase pay.\n\n_Alison Roller is a freelance writer with experience in tech, HR and marketing._\n\n#### Related Resources\n\n- [The Impact of AI on the CIO Career](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9059/633088)\u2013Talk\n- [Leveraging Learning to Create Community and Purpose in the Workplace](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/16593/631151)\u2013Talk\n- [Part One: A Day in the Life of a Threat Analyst](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/19394/626557)\u2013Replay\n- [How To Set Up An HR Function: The Essential Guide And Checklist](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1722402043_633.html)\u2013Sage\n\n#### Dig Deeper on IT career paths\n\n- [**Tech sector layoffs explained: What you need to know**\\\\\n\\\\\n![AmandaHetler](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/hetler_amanda.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Amanda\u00a0Hetler](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Tech-sector-layoffs-explained-What-you-need-to-know)\n- [**Tech sector layoffs mount amid AI investment frenzy**\\\\\n\\\\\n![SebastianKlovig Skelton](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/computerweekly/Sebastian-Klovig-Skelton-CW-contributor.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Sebastian\u00a0Klovig Skelton](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366606035/Tech-sector-layoffs-mount-amid-AI-investment-frenzy)\n- [**AI and cyber skills worryingly lacking, say business leaders**\\\\\n\\\\\n![ClareMcDonald](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/computerweekly/Clare-Ellen-McDonald-140px.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Clare\u00a0McDonald](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366593173/AI-and-cyber-skills-worryingly-lacking-say-business-leaders)\n- [**A bad tech job market wants good AI skills**\\\\\n\\\\\n![PatrickThibodeau](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Patrick\u00a0Thibodeau](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/news/366574674/A-bad-tech-job-market-wants-good-AI-skills)\n\n[Search Networking](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/)\n\n- [What is network management?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-management)\nNetwork management is a multifaceted discipline that provides network administrators with the tools, protocols and processes to ...\n\n- [What is network downtime?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-downtime)\nNetwork downtime refers to inaccessibility to part or all of a network due to the failure of hardware, software or some ...\n\n- [What is PSTN (public switched telephone network)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/PSTN)\nPSTN (public switched telephone network) is the world's collection of interconnected voice-oriented public telephone networks via...\n\n\n[Search Security](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/)\n\n- [What is a public key and how does it work?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)\nIn cryptography, a public key is a large numerical value that is used to encrypt data.\n\n- [What is a proxy firewall?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/proxy-firewall)\nA proxy firewall is a network security system that protects network resources by filtering messages at the application layer.\n\n- [What is a public key certificate?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key-certificate)\nA public key certificate is a digitally signed document that serves to validate the sender's authorization and name.\n\n\n[Search CIO](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/)\n\n- [What is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act)\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act or GLBA), also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, is a federal law enacted in ...\n\n- [What is a CVO (chief visionary officer)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/CVO)\nThe CVO (chief visionary officer) is a newer C-suite title where the holder is expected to have a broad and comprehensive ...\n\n- [What is a balanced scorecard and how does the methodology work?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/balanced-scorecard-methodology)\nThe balanced scorecard is a management system aimed at translating an organization's strategic goals into a set of organizational...\n\n\n[Search HRSoftware](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/)\n\n- [What is employee self-service (ESS)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/definition/employee-self-service)\nEmployee self-service (ESS) is a widely used human resources technology that enables employees to perform many job-related ...\n\n- [What is DEI?

As the economy slowly shifts and technology rapidly evolves, change is unavoidable, but it doesn\u2019t need to be another hiring obstacle. In 2024, the companies who persevere will be the ones who don\u2019t fear shifts but embrace them.\n\nTo build and retain winning teams, leaders must stay on top of the latest talent acquisition trends. The hiring landscape is ever-evolving, along with the strategies, values, and expectations of the workforce. In response, businesses everywhere are rethinking who to hire, where work is done, and how to achieve their goals.\n\nWhether recruiting for creative, marketing or tech teams this year \u2013 if you hope to achieve success, these are the 2024 hiring trends and market shifts you can\u2019t ignore.\n\n1.

[DEI is now DEIA.](#Hiring Trend 4)\n5. [Emerging tech roles are on the rise.](#Hiring Trend 5)\n6. [AI is changing how we find talent and jobs.](#Hiring Trend 6)\n7. [The contingent staffing surge continues.](#Hiring Trend 7)\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#1: The job market is tight. The talent market is tighter.**\n\nDespite slowing economic growth, 85% of hiring managers indicate their companies are likely to hire talent this year, based on the data obtained from our 2024 Hiring Trends survey. In addition, over 40% admit their teams are currently understaffed, listing employee turnover as the top reason for new jobs opening.\n\nThe [latest US jobs report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) supports our findings, showing there are currently more jobs open than talent available for hire. While recent headcount reductions introduced a wave of new candidates into the market, skilled professionals quickly found new opportunities, and job-switching remains at [a historical high](https://www.hiringlab.org/2023/11/15/indeeds-2024-us-jobs-hiring-trends-report/) across industries. Our recent poll of 1,000+ LinkedIn users revealed that 76% of candidates plan to switch jobs or companies in 2024.\n\nTo step ahead of the competition, attract top talent, and improve retention \u2013 leaders are making a strategic effort to be more empathetic toward their employees and prospective hires. Companies everywhere are revising their compensation packages, expanding their benefits offerings, and updating their hiring processes with job candidate preferences at heart.\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#2: Hybrid is the next normal.**\n\nOur 2024 Hiring Trends survey also demonstrated that today\u2019s employees value flexibility and autonomy more than ever before. 90% of job seeker respondents indicated they would leave on-site jobs for remote opportunities. After experiencing [the dual benefits of relaxed work-from-home policies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2020/02/12/top-5-benefits-of-remote-work-for-companies/?sh=4a917d1616c8), many individual contributors and managers alike are reluctant to return to the office.\n\nAt the same time, business leaders are increasingly in favor of in-person work, with more than 2 out of 3 hiring managers unveiling plans to return to the office at least for part of the time in 2024. In light of recent world events and economic developments, there\u2019s a renewed focus on workplace productivity across industries, and remote work\u2019s impact on employee performance remains a subject of debate.\n\nAs companies carefully balance their growth goals with job seeker expectations, 60% of hiring managers say that hybrid work will be the most common arrangement of 2024. In [the words of Francine Katsoudas](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2023/m10/a-magnet-not-a-mandate-chuck-robbins-on-office-transformation.html#:~:text=Today's%20workers%20demand%20flexibility.,but%20not%20every%20day!).), Chief People, Policy & Purpose Officer of Cisco, _\u201cThe office should be a magnet, not a mandate.\u201d_\n\n[![request local talent](http://www.onwardsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/request-local-talent-button-300x59.png)](https://www.onwardsearch.com/request-talent/?utm_source=2024+Hiring+Trends&utm_medium=blog&utm_id=2024hiringtrendsblog)\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#3: Pay transparency laws are changing.**\n\nBeyond flexibility, today\u2019s talent demand transparency. As of the start of 2024, eight US states and a growing number of cities have implemented [pay disclosure laws](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/04/is-pay-transparency-good-for-business-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-in-2023/). Last year also saw [a new bill](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/national-pay-transparency-bill-proposed/) introduced to congress that could require employers in all states to disclose pay ranges, if passed. This year, US pay transparency laws and company policies are expected to multiply, and hiring managers are increasingly disclosing pay upfront on their own accord.\n\nPay disclosure is not yet a nation-wide legal mandate in the US, but it is a competitive advantage for companies across states. 99% of creative, marketing and tech professionals responded they would be more likely to apply to companies that embrace pay transparency when asked in our 2024 Hiring Trends survey. The survey also found that 1 in 3 professionals still value compensation above all else.\n\nWhile job seekers have much to consider in 2024, salaries remain among the top reasons that organizations win and lose great hires. As recent pay transparency trends place a renewed focus on wages, companies everywhere are leveraging resources like [our 2024 Salary Guide](https://www.onwardsearch.com/salary-guide-2023/) to craft equitable and competitive pay ranges.\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#4: DEI is now DEIA.**\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) continues to be a focus for job seekers and hiring managers alike. Recent studies revealed that [75% of HR leaders](https://www.ey.com/en_ro/news/2023/09/ey-study-workers-feel-a-sense-of-belonging-at-their-workplaces) say their company will prioritize diversity hiring in 2024, while [85% of professionals](https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/boost-accessibility-in-2024-digital-accessibility-strategies-for-success-no-matter-where-youre-starting/) consider digital accessibility a competitive advantage for their organization.\n\nAlthough \u201cDEI\u201d remains [the most common acronym](https://powertofly.com/up/diversity-and-inclusion-acronyms#:~:text=With%20over%202.5%20billion%20results,9%20million%20search%20results%20respectively.) used for corporate inclusion programs in the US, there\u2019s recently been a push to add an \u201cA\u201d for \u201caccessibility\u201d and turn \u201cDEI\u201d to \u201cDEIA.\u201d Accessibility and inclusive design are growing priorities for HR departments looking to improve their hiring processes and accommodate people with disabilities. In addition \u2013 marketing, product and design teams are increasingly hiring digital accessibility experts to make their experiences accessible for all.\n\nWhile the one billion people with disabilities provide companies with more than enough reasons to invest in accessibility, the [recent uptick in ADA lawsuits](https://www.onwardsearch.com/digital-accessibility-advocacy-guide/) has undoubtedly contributed to the rise in awareness. Resources like our newly released [Digital Accessibility Advocacy Guide](https://www.onwardsearch.com/digital-accessibility-advocacy-guide/) can help professionals advocate for A11Y initiatives within their organizations. To paraphrase the words of [Level Access](https://www.levelaccess.com/), _there is no \u201cD,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d or \u201cI\u201d without \u201cA.\u201d_\n\n[![download the accessibility advocacy guide ](http://www.onwardsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Download-the-Accessibility-Advocacy-Guide-1024x100.png)](https://www.onwardsearch.com/digital-accessibility-advocacy-guide/?utm_source=2024+Hiring+Trends&utm_medium=blog&utm_id=2024hiringtrendsblog)\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#5: Emerging tech roles are on the rise.**\n\nDigital accessibility isn\u2019t the only area of expertise in increasingly high demand. Over 50% of companies plan to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) this year, and AI advancements are predicted to result in [97 million new jobs](https://allwork.space/2021/11/ai-will-create-97-million-jobs-but-workers-dont-have-the-skills-required-yet/) by 2025. From Chief AI Officers to AI Prompt Engineers, [new AI roles](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/12/10-in-demand-ai-jobs-2024/) have already emerged, and the demand for these experts is expected to grow through 2024.\n\nWidely regarded as [today\u2019s most talked about innovation](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/06/human-creativity-vs-artificial-intelligence/), AI stole the spotlight from Web3 and extended reality (XR) technologies in 2023, but it is also pushing them forward in 2024. Among its countless capabilities, AI has the potential to accelerate blockchain and [metaverse development](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2022/10/10-most-in-demand-metaverse-hires/). We recently polled over 200 professionals on the value of virtual reality (VR) worlds today, and over 70% agreed that brands should invest in immersive experiences.\n\nEmerging technologies have already advanced at an unprecedented rate in recent months, and specialists predict that 2024 will bring more technological advancements than many creatives, marketers and even tech experts could imagine. Businesses everywhere are competing to develop and master the latest AI tools, but a tool is only as strong as the talent behind it, and new innovations call for new hires.\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#6: AI is changing how we find talent and jobs.**\n\nIn 2024, the rise of AI is transforming the way companies hire and how professionals apply. [New AI recruitment tools](https://www.unite.ai/ai-recruiting-tools/) seem to emerge every day, and over 80% of our 2024 Hiring Trends survey respondents have stated their teams are already using AI, [investing in training](https://www.onwardsearch.com/generative-ai-training/), or looking into adoption.\n\nInnovative companies are leveraging algorithms for everything [from resume filtering to employee turnover prediction](https://www.ssonetwork.com/intelligent-automation/articles/beginners-guide-to-generative-ai-in-recruiting). Generative AI tools draft job descriptions, advanced chatbots answer candidate questions in real time, and automated candidate recommendations eliminate hiring bias. At the same time, job seekers are leveraging AI to update their resumes, search for jobs, draft cover letters and more.\n\nWhen used properly, AI\u2019s possibilities are seemingly endless for talent, recruiters, and hiring managers alike. As new hiring tools, widgets and plug-ins emerge, the teams that adapt will be the ones to thrive.\n\n[![request ai experts](http://www.onwardsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ai-experts-button-300x59.png)](https://www.onwardsearch.com/request-talent/?utm_source=2024+Hiring+Trends&utm_medium=blog&utm_id=2024hiringtrendsblog)\n\n### **Hiring Trend \\#7: [The contingent staffing surge](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/02/the-contingent-staffing-surge-of-2023-why-on-demand-talent-is-in-demand/) continues.**\n\nEntering 2024, companies are racing to upskill their teams while doubling down on cost-saving strategies. As a result, the gig economy\u2019s growth shows no signs of slowing down. From freelance talent to contract consultants and fractional executives, leaders continue to rely upon cost-effective talent solutions to elevate their teams.\n\n[80% of companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/hr-statistics-trends/) say they\u2019re leveraging contingent workers for hard-to-fill roles in 2024, while over 60% of professionals say they would consider freelance or contract work. The nature of contingent labor gives businesses the capacity to scale their workforce up or down to meet changing needs. At the same time, contract work provides professionals with the ability to choose the projects that best suit their interests and availability.\n\nThe [freelance revolution](https://www.onwardsearch.com/blog/2023/02/the-contingent-staffing-surge-of-2023-why-on-demand-talent-is-in-demand/) has been steadily building for some time. Recent market shifts only amplified the surge. As 2024 goes into full swing, companies must evaluate if contingent talent solutions are right for their organizations, consider their staffing partner options, and adapt their hiring strategies to our new reality.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Hit your 2024 hiring goals.**\n\nOnward Search specializes in staffing and talent solutions at the intersection of creative and technology.

It\u2019s not just you. Job openings recently fell to a 3-year low in 2024. This comes after waves of [tech layoffs](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/what-to-do-after-getting-laid-off/) and share price drops at [top tech companies.](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-to-get-a-job-at-company)\n\nThe tech job market is highly competitive, but probably not for the reasons you expect. Did you know [it takes 130-200+ jobs to land a job now](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-long-does-it-take-to-find-a-job/), on average? Or that [recruiters filter out candidates using automated tracking systems (ATS)](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/best-resume-format-for-ats-with-resume-template/)? Understanding how hiring is changing can help you understand exactly what you need to do to land a job in the competitive 2024 tech job market.\n\n**1\\. The Labor Market Cooled Off**\n\nThe tech job market cooled off in early 2024, in part due to inflation and rising interest rates. Our 2024 job report found that [it was harder to find a job in 2024](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-long-does-it-take-to-find-a-job) compared to recent years. [Job postings fell 15%](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/job-postings-fell-15-from-last-year:-this-job-is-suffering-the-most) at the end of 2023. In 2022, there were about 1 job for every 1 job seeker. [In 2023, there were 1 job for every 2 job seekers.](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-long-does-it-take-to-find-a-job)\n\n![Why can't you find a job 2024](https://pathrise-website-guide-wp.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/guides/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/26230625/Why-impossible-to-find-a-job_2024_Graphic.png)\n\nThe 1:2 ratio still technically makes it a job seekers market. But job seekers certainly don\u2019t feel this way. [Job seeker confidence](https://www.ziprecruiter-research.org/job-seeker-confidence) in Q2 2024 fell to its lowest level in more than two years, according to a ZipRecruiter survey. Despite mixed statistics, it feels like you can\u2019t land a job right now. Part of this tech job market pessimism likely has to do with the job seeker experience (more interviews, more ghost jobs, etc), while another part is probably because the rate of hiring by employers is at its [lowest](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1qypk) since 2017. Job seekers are feeling the squeeze of a cooler labor market.\n\n**2\\. Layoffs Make the Tech job Market 2024 Especially Competitive**\n\nAfter extensive layoffs in 2022 and 2023, the 2024 tech job [market is flooded with recently laid off tech professionals](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-layoffs-are-affecting-competition-for-tech-jobs/) competing for a limited number of jobs. With more job seekers and fewer positions, the 2024 tech job market is more competitive. LinkedIn job postings can get hundreds of applicants as soon as they\u2019re posted.\n\nHiring is especially competitive at top companies. FAANG companies [Google](https://www.pathrise.com/companies/google), [Apple](https://www.pathrise.com/companies/apple), and [Amazon](https://www.pathrise.com/companies/amazon) laid off thousands of employees in recent years. Among the top FAANG companies, [only Meta seems to be hiring actively in 2024](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/7-san-francisco-companies-that-are-hiring-for-software-engineer-jobs/). While newer growing companies like [Nvidia](https://www.pathrise.com/companies/nvidia) and [Rippling](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/rippling-careers/) are actively hiring, standards are still extremely high due to the high level of talent in the market. This means companies can afford to be picky. According to LinkedIn data, roughly 54% of recruiters cite the [quality of hires as their main goal](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/future-of-recruiting?trk=jnt-mmnt-bl-po-q3fy24) for the next five years until 2029.\n\n![Meta SWE jobs](https://pathrise-website-guide-wp.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/guides/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/21181912/Meta-1080-x-1080-px1.png)\n\n**3\\. Ghost Jobs**\n\nJob boards like LinkedIn are also flooded with \u201cghost jobs\u201d: job postings that companies never intend to fill or that have already been filled. These job postings waste applicants\u2019 time, and can leave them discouraged when they never hear back. It can feel like sending applicants into a blackhole, with no feedback.\n\n![Ghost Jobs](https://pathrise-website-guide-wp.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/guides/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/26230835/2.png)\n\nOften, a recruiter just forgot to take down the job posting or left the company. With smaller and fewer recruiting teams due to automation, responding to a candidate can easily slip the minds of a busy recruiter. Sometimes recruiters don\u2019t want to hire for the role right now, but they want to collect resumes to find talented candidates to hire for this role or another later. Companies may also post ghost jobs to try to raise the morale of their teams, showing that they have an interest in hiring someone to help ease the workload if the right candidate comes along. But often, they\u2019re not serious about hiring a candidate.\n\nMore commonly, companies (especially startups) post ghost jobs to show that they\u2019re growing. Posting hundreds of open jobs tells investors that the company is healthy and growing rapidly. For startups, this can increase their chance at raising capital and win them free press. For bigger companies, this can increase the company\u2019s value. No matter the company size, posting new jobs can boost employee morale. After all, isn\u2019t a growing company a great place to work?\n\n![Ghost Job Reasons](https://pathrise-website-guide-wp.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/guides/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/26230951/5.png)\n\nWhile motivations behind ghost jobs aren\u2019t malicious, they\u2019re extremely harmful to job seekers. Not only do they hurt job seeker morale when they never hear back, they waste valuable time that could otherwise be spent [applying to real jobs with an optimal strategy](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/the-most-effective-job-search-techniques/). A job seeker working a full-time job may only have a few hours per week to apply to jobs. In the past, most of the jobs they applied to would have actually been interested in hiring. Today, [almost a third of jobs they apply to could be a complete waste of time](https://fortune.com/2024/08/19/recruiters-posting-ghost-jobs-problem-job-seekers/) with no interest in hiring. This means it could take significantly longer to find a job.\n\n![How common are ghost jobs?](https://pathrise-website-guide-wp.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/guides/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/26231134/4.png)\n\n**4\\. Fewer Recruiters and Increased Automation**\n\n[New AI recruiting tools have changed hiring](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-ai-afects-your-application-for-amazon/). While they can streamline the recruiting process, they also reduce the number of recruiters necessary to parse candidate resumes or even reach out directly. This can make the recruiting process feel less personal as automatic form rejections increase. Application tracking systems (ATS) can also be more strict about identifying skills, filtering candidates who may have otherwise been appealing. [Without the correct resume format, you could be filtered out](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/8-best-resume-format-tips-for-hiring-algorithms/) without the attention your application deserves.\n\nWhile controversial, [some data suggests automation and AI tools have already impacted the tech job market.](https://seo.ai/blog/ai-replacing-jobs-statistics) While still in high demand, some aspects of data analyst and web developer roles can be automated. This doesn\u2019t mean these roles aren\u2019t still invaluable. It just means that fewer total may be necessary for a company as technology empowers them to achieve more with fewer teammates.\n\n**5\\. Skills over Education in Hiring**\n\nCompanies are shifting towards valuing skills over academic degrees. In 2024, [79% of hiring managers reported prioritizing practical skills](https://oneten.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OneTen_Embracing_a_Skills-First_Mindset.pdf), experience, and past achievements above education.\n\nOn paper, this sounds like it would mean less gatekeeping and a fairer interview process if you have the [most in-demand tech skills hiring managers are looking for](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/skills-that-are-in-demand-for-tech-jobs/). In practice, it seems to mean a much more competitive tech job market, especially for [new grads looking for their first job](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-to-land-entry-level-software-engineering-jobs-for-bootcamp-grads/).\n\nPrioritizing skills over education means that college degrees may not always hold the same weight, putting recent graduates in a bind. After all, how do recent grads acquire skills and experiences if they need to develop skills and experiences on the job? Prioritizing skills over education also means that employers have a wider pool of candidates to choose from, further increasing competition.\n\nHigh-level skills are also harder to find than education, since historically skills were often built on the job. This means despite many candidates applying, companies may not find any to have the specific skills up to a high enough level. A silver lining to this trend is that online courses, bootcamps, and certifications can help give you the edge over competition that may not have the specific job skills. However, [even the best bootcamps](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/best-online-coding-bootcamps/) alone have been shown to not always guarantee grads the level of skill required for roles. Meaning college alternatives like bootcamps or certifications are not a silver bullet to skills-based hiring. Candidates may have better luck learning to [ace common technical interview questions](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/software-engineer-interview-questions/) and [master Leetcode challenges](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/a-review-of-leetcode-as-a-software-engineer-interview-prep-tool/) themselves.\n\n**6\\. Fewer Entry-level Positions**\n\nPrioritizing skills means fewer entry-level roles, which are tailored to lower-skilled candidates with less experience. By the end of April 2024, [entry-level positions constituted only 2.5% of the total jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/navigating-evolving-entry-level-job-market-2024-mfhfc) posted on platforms like ZipRecruiter. Only 1.9% of offers do not require previous experience.\n\nWhen posted, today\u2019s \u201centry-level roles\u201d often require 5 years of experience. Job seekers may be intimidated and not apply, due to [imposter syndrome](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/a-pathrise-fellow-on-how-to-overcome-imposter-syndrome/) or a genuine lack of qualifications. Worse, more than a third of employers reported a preference not to avoid hiring Gen Z candidates, probably because of a perceived lack of skills and on-the-job experience.\n\nAnother factor in competition for entry-level jobs is the increase in education overall. While more people are earning college degrees for white collar work, the supply of white collar jobs remains roughly the same. This means a glut of overqualified recent grads competing over a limited number of spaces. But it\u2019s important to keep in mind that for in-demand jobs, like these [top 5 highest paying tech roles](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/10-highest-salary-tech-jobs/), the demand is still greater than the supply. If you\u2019re trying to find a tech job, especially in STEM, this likely doesn\u2019t apply to your search. But it still applies to elite roles at top tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, or Google. While engineers are always in demand, enrollment in [the 20 highest paying college majors](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/highest-paying-college-majors/) like computer science have [increased 34% since 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/05/19/college-majors-computer-science-humanities/), meaning the [highest paying companies](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-to-get-a-job-at-the-highest-paying-companies/) have more elite talent to choose from.\n\n**7\\. More Extensive Interview Processes**\n\nNow that the cooled labor market means companies can afford to be pickier, interviews have gotten longer. While interviews used to be 1-4 rounds, now they can be 5-8+, especially for competitive tech roles with technical components. As recruiters prioritize quality over quantity, they can ask candidates to jump through more hoops like extra behavioral interviews and even take-home assignments.\n\nWhile more interviews reduce your chances of getting hired, they can also discourage candidates who may not want to invest so much valuable job searching time into take-home assignments, which can help offset the reduced odds.\n\n**8\\. Silver lining: High Interest in Hiring**\n\nWhile job seekers face more competition, companies are still hiring. In fact, [more than half of companies plan to increase their hiring in the first half of 2024](https://press.roberthalf.com/2023-12-07-More-Than-Half-of-U-S-Companies-Plan-to-Increase-Hiring-in-the-First-Half-of-2024). While standards are high, companies still need to hire for critical roles. And plenty of companies like [Rippling](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/rippling-careers/) or [Meta](https://www.pathrise.com/companies/meta-interview-process) are aggressively hiring for high paying roles. You just have to present yourself well enough to meet companies\u2019 high standards.\n\nIn a competitive tech job market, it\u2019s more important than ever to make your job search materials. Your resume, portfolio, and interview skills should all be optimized to give you the best chance of landing a job.

This decline follows a trend of cautious hiring, reflecting companies' concerns about ongoing inflation and market volatility. While the broader job market remains resilient, this reduction in job postings suggests that businesses are adopting a wait-and-see approach, particularly in industries sensitive to economic conditions.\n- Looking Ahead: The tension between fostering job creation and managing inflation remains at the forefront of economic policy. With businesses navigating higher costs and uncertainty about interest rate cuts, the job market is likely to continue facing mixed signals in the coming months.\n- From our data we see that there has been a significant increase in the number of \u201cremoved jobs\u201d of around 103,000 from August to September. With inflation management still a top priority, there is hesitation about cutting interest rates too quickly, even though such a move could stimulate business growth.\n\n### U.S. Job Listings by Month \\| January 2020 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGjdolhTBvs2w/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729276888968?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hFjj4k2_EUH39I5Y51ubA7MeRs8d9qaEjfw4tRaJS6Q)\n\n* * *\n\n## LinkUp 10,000\n\nThe [LinkUp 10,000](https://www.linkup.com/data/10000) is an analytic published daily and monthly that captures the total U.S. job openings from the 10,000 global employers in LinkUp\u2019s jobs dataset with the most U.S. openings.\n\nIn September, the job market experienced a slight dip in momentum, with the monthly LinkUp 10,000 index falling by 1.0% compared to the previous month. The current monthly job listings stand at 4,783,299, down from 4,829,875 in August. This drop follows a similar trend of cautious hiring observed in the later half of the summer, suggesting that businesses may be holding back amid broader economic uncertainties. However, despite this monthly decrease, the overall index is still 9.4% lower than this time last year, reflecting a sustained shift in the labor market.\n\nIn summary, September saw a continued contraction in job postings, marking a challenging environment despite isolated growth sectors.\n\n### Monthly LinkUp 10,000 \\| January 2021 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQH1mvMm77GT5A/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729276971615?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nLOnb0tDzj-_HWkGA7eQ_yuMnIYz4W7Ij31vYgdcG40)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By Industry (NAICS)\n\nWe're seeing an increase in open jobs across 30% of industries this month, with the largest gains observed in:\n\n- Retail (+41k)\n- Finance and Insurance (+39.4k)\n- Wholesale Trade (+14.5k)\n\nIndustries that experienced the largest drops:\n\n- Public Administration (-60k)\n- Healthcare (-20.8k)\n- Education (-19.8k)\n\n### Job Listings by Industry (NAICS) \\| September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG0ByQrqzv-bw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277009565?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aM5tCyQa_eWBmFtbQ3EbzThW_z6-Bkg9pHThT056Sow)\n\n## Industry Spotlight:\n\n## Retail \u2013 General Merchandise\n\nThis sector experienced a notable 7% increase in job listings for September, likely driven by heightened consumer demand, strategic expansion efforts, and inflationary pressures shifting consumer behavior. As prices rise across the board, more shoppers are turning to budget-friendly options, like dollar stores, for essential goods. A prime example is Dollar General, which, despite facing weaker earnings, continues its aggressive real-estate expansion.\n\nWith over 20,000 locations in 48 states, Dollar General boosted hiring last year to enhance customer experience and added staff at self-checkout areas to mitigate retail theft. Similarly, Dollar Tree has opened more than 300 new stores this year and acquired 170 leases from the bankrupt 99 Cents Only Stores, reopening over 100 locations and planning an additional 50 by the end of 2024. Together, Dollar General and Dollar Tree are set to open over 1,300 new locations this fiscal year, outpacing other retailers and reflecting their confidence in growth through expansion.\n\n### Daily Job Listings: Rise in Number of Active jobs in September in the Dollar General\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQG_pHuqgRFmNw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277053909?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=POqU_ig1kDqSUOToey_DJewLxPAM2q-Kq8x_OREivB8)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By Occupation (O\\*NET)\n\nIn step with the job postings across U.S. industries this month, 24% of occupational groups saw a rise in hiring.\n\nOccupations with a rise in demand:\n\n- Sales and Related (+37.1k)\n- Personal Care (+9.9k)\n- Computer and Mathematical (+8.4k)\n\nOccupations with a drop in demand:\n\n- Education Instruction and Library (-33.9k)\n- Healthcare Practitioners and technical (-14.6k)\n\n## Recommended by LinkedIn\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFynnru1I2NXw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1697128191400?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9-i4bJjOE5MudupxUOWe0h2j0lPKV3PbMtApGVUyAYk)\\\\\nQ4 Newsletter\\\\\n\\\\\nSoni\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/q4-newsletter-soni-resources-group)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQF79DEJ-Py2Ww/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1675948243714?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WbUMMyr2F58g9vpj9E0UgahbITS0GJ1COPNNHFPKjsg)\\\\\nA Strengthening Job Market \u2013 January 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nRose International\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strengthening-job-market-january-2023-rose-international)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGnqH3Ln7azFA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1681365338659?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Zij85VwasnlH5ZIADki37JBciP2eQ36Z2XuOPryyT8A)\\\\\nAn Expanding Job Market \u2013 March 2023\\\\\n\\\\\nRose International\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/expanding-job-market-march-2023-rose-international)\n\n### Job Listings by Occupation (O\\*NET) \\| September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFgPn72kh1LlA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277074883?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WcQikZYCl3ALo6pgeyEr47ralwt-K9y1thp-z-jXqGU)\n\n## Occupation Spotlight:\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Art/Design/Entertainment/Media occupations saw a 9% drop in job listings, reflecting the industry's ongoing challenges. This decline could be attributed to shifts in consumer habits, reduced spending on non-essential goods, and growing automation in creative roles. A notable example is Warner Music Group (WMG), which recently announced 750 layoffs as part of a restructuring effort. The company is aiming to streamline its recorded music business by cutting 13% of its workforce, with most of the layoffs affecting corporate and support roles. While traditional creative jobs are shrinking, there\u2019s a noticeable rise in AI-related roles, as entertainment companies like WMG increasingly look to technology to reshape the future of media.\n\n### Warner Music Group Software Developer hires spike in Q2, Q3\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEF1nxy5bh4ug/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277128080?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=lIcJuD2IDZdYLaaVCnAN6YVtOgrStvDIvesDzCU_080)\n\n### WMG Active Jobs requiring Artificial Intelligence skill since 1/1/23\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHeqy3IRi6jCg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277143940?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hxErdvhSmGMTEYG5lVvhInshluJuLUV8sHCUtYX7d44)\n\n## Computer and Mathematical\n\nComputer and Mathematical job listings saw a modest 3.2% increase reflecting a cautious but steady uptick in hiring. Companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Meta have all shown slight improvements in their job postings. However, one notable exception is Microsoft, which seems to be lagging in this department, showing either stagnant or reduced hiring trends. The overall trend suggests that, while the tech industry is slowly recovering from earlier slowdowns, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Some companies are clearly ramping up their technical talent, while others, like Microsoft, may be taking a more conservative approach.\n\n### Computer and Mathematical roles Active Job Listings in Magnificent seven companies in September\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEYkcy2rnp3jg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277190829?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=QSP17IIcihXu6J8_r4xm2JKPDCbHanMbC06L4wOBDGU)\n\n* * *\n\n## Closed Duration\n\nClosed duration, or the average number of days job listings are posted on company websites before they are removed, tracks hiring velocity across the entire U.S. economy. As the average number of days a job listing remains live increases, hiring velocity slows.\n\nThe closed duration increased in September, rising by 5.5 days from August's figure to a total of 46 days.\n\n### Closed Duration of U.S. Jobs \\| January 2020 - September 2024\n\n![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQF0dccOJ4ySOg/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1729277217374?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ih-gtwMxWhpFjAxonNX9HtE6X2vkmyRMcFzdkHjI76k)\n\n* * *\n\n## Jobs Data By State\n\nDuring the month of September, 25% of the United States saw an increase in job listings.

Add in the exponential growth of [AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence) and automation, and it's no surprise the tech job market has been roiled over the past few years.\n\nAs technology advances and companies attempt to keep pace amid constant volatility, it begs the question: Will the uncertainty of the tech job market -- slow job growth, continuous layoffs and skill shortages -- continue into 2025?\n\nHere are some statistics that clarify the tech job market in 2025.\n\n## 1\\. Tech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow at twice the rate of the overall workforce in the next decade\n\nTech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow much faster than average, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association's (CompTIA) 2024 \" [State of the Tech Workforce](https://www.comptia.org/content/research/state-of-the-tech-workforce)\" report. The report projected tech job growth from 6 million in 2024 to 7.1 million in 2034.\n\nAccording to research from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/), computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than average from 2023 to 2033, with a projected 356,700 job openings annually.\n\n## 2\\. More than 90% of organizations worldwide will be affected by the IT skills shortage by 2026\n\nBy 2026, the IT skills shortage will become a significant problem for most organizations globally, resulting in $5.5 trillion in losses, according to an IDC [survey](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52128824) of North American IT leaders. Organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry [predicted](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/talent-crunch-future-of-work) the skills shortage might leave as many as 85 million unfilled tech-related jobs by 2030.\n\nThe IT skills shortage may already be here. No longer a looming issue, AI and other technologies continue to advance faster than workers and organizations can react. Staffing firm [Robert Half](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/building-tech-teams) reported that 95% of tech leaders who responded to its survey currently face challenges finding skilled workers.\n\n## 3\\. 48% of tech organizations are prioritizing upskilling and cross-skilling over new hires\n\n[The Linux Foundation](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/2023-state-of-tech-talent-report-acquiring-and-retaining-technical-talent-in-2023-kh-0) reported that a growing number of organizations, in response to technological advances and a tough labor market, are investing internally to close skill gaps rather than hiring new talent or consultants.\n\nOrganizations continue to prioritize [upskilling](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/upskilling), [reskilling](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/definition/reskilling) and cross-skilling to meet their needs. After all, the half-life of technology skills is as short as 2.5 years, according to [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2023/09/reskilling-in-the-age-of-ai). The World Economic Forum, back in October 2020, [noted](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/) that more than half of workers require skilling of some type by 2025 due to rapid technology advancements.\n\n## 4\\. Python is the most in-demand programming language\n\nAccording to Indeed's \"Tapping Into Today's Tech Talent\" [report](https://www.indeed.com/lead/tapping-into-todays-tech-talent) from October 2024, [Python](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Python) is the most in-demand skill in job listings, followed by experience with [AWS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchaws/definition/Amazon-Web-Services), which enjoyed the largest growth in demand in the last year, as well as Oracle, Java and JavaScript.\n\n[PyTorch](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/PyTorch), Rust, [TensorFlow](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/TensorFlow), Flutter and Dart were listed as other fast-growing areas. Xamarin, Erlang, Azure and iOS faced the biggest declines in demand, according to the report, with Erlang among the list of [dying programming languages](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/5-dead-programming-languages-we-should-never-forget).\n\n## 5\\. The worldwide average salary for IT professionals is $88,448\n\n[Skillsoft's \"2024-25 IT Skills and Salary Report\"](https://cdn.bfldr.com/SDYPVW60/at/vfhxpgf7bh3qnc8bhnj9wk7/Skillsoft_IT_Skills_Salary_Report_2024.pdf) stated the average worldwide salary for IT professionals has increased nearly 5% since last year. North America recorded the highest average salary of $113,211 in comparison to three other regions: Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia-Pacific.\n\n[C-level](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/C-level) IT executives earned the highest salaries, according to the report, followed by IT architecture and design, and then cloud computing. In North America, the highest salaries are in the IT software sector. Meanwhile, IT professionals in the education sector reported the lowest average salary.\n\n## 6\\. LinkedIn job listings referencing AI have more than doubled worldwide from 2021 to 2023\n\nLinkedIn's November 2023 \"Future of Work Report: AI at Work\" [highlighted](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/economicgraph/en-us/PDF/future-of-work-report-ai-november-2023.pdf) the ever-increasing demand for AI skills as organizations integrate AI into their business practices. Other hiring platforms concur. [Indeed's Hiring Lab](https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/03/14/march-2024-us-labor-market-update/) reported a 30-fold increase in [generative AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI)-related jobs from January 2023 to February 2024, though they still make up a relatively small part of total jobs.\n\nThat is changing as organizations focus on [AI skills entering 2025](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/9-top-AI-and-machine-learning-trends). A [ResumeTemplates.com survey](https://www.resumetemplates.com/4-in-10-companies-will-replace-workers-with-ai-in-2025/) found that 87% of leaders who plan to hire list AI experience as valuable for job seekers. Plus, AI skills benefit current employees. For example, in its [2025 salary guide](https://www.roberthalf.com/us/en/insights/salary-guide/technology), Robert Half reported that 44% of organizations boost pay for workers with AI and [machine learning](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML) skills.\n\n## 7\\. Nontech industries hired more tech talent workers than the tech industry in 2023\n\nCBRE, a commercial real estate services and investment firm, found tech industry hiring is slowing. Nontech industries hire more tech talent than tech industries, a first in the CBRE \"[Scoring Tech Talent\" report](https://www.cbre.com/insights/books/scoring-tech-talent-2024)'s 11-year history.\n\nWhile the tech industry added nearly 29,000 tech talent jobs in 2023, the report noted professional and business services, excluding tech, netted almost 50,000 jobs, followed by roughly 45,000 in the transportation, warehousing and wholesale sectors.\n\n## 8\\. More than 225,000 tech employees have been laid off in 2024\n\nLayoffs, rampant in the tech industry since the pandemic, aren't stopping. [TrueUp's layoff tracker](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs) reported more than 1,000 rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting nearly 700 people per day.\n\nContinuous layoffs parallel an uptick in unemployment for tech workers. According to [CompTIA's \"Tech Jobs Report\"](https://www.comptia.org/content/tech-jobs-report), in June 2024, unemployment for IT professionals reached 3.7%, the highest mark since August 2020.\n\n## 9\\. 56% of tech managers are loosening experience requirements to speed the hiring process\n\nTo combat hiring challenges, organizations are deprioritizing experience to help find and hire tech talent faster, according to Robert Half's 2025 salary guide. Additionally, the salary guide found technology leaders are taking other measures to attract top candidates, including 45% of leaders who've decided to increase pay.\n\n_Alison Roller is a freelance writer with experience in tech, HR and marketing._\n\n#### Related Resources\n\n- [The Impact of AI on the CIO Career](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9059/633088)\u2013Talk\n- [Leveraging Learning to Create Community and Purpose in the Workplace](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/16593/631151)\u2013Talk\n- [Part One: A Day in the Life of a Threat Analyst](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/19394/626557)\u2013Replay\n- [How To Set Up An HR Function: The Essential Guide And Checklist](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1722402043_633.html)\u2013Sage\n\n#### Dig Deeper on IT career paths\n\n- [**Tech sector layoffs explained: What you need to know**\\\\\n\\\\\n![AmandaHetler](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/hetler_amanda.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Amanda\u00a0Hetler](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Tech-sector-layoffs-explained-What-you-need-to-know)\n- [**Tech sector layoffs mount amid AI investment frenzy**\\\\\n\\\\\n![SebastianKlovig Skelton](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/computerweekly/Sebastian-Klovig-Skelton-CW-contributor.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Sebastian\u00a0Klovig Skelton](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366606035/Tech-sector-layoffs-mount-amid-AI-investment-frenzy)\n- [**AI and cyber skills worryingly lacking, say business leaders**\\\\\n\\\\\n![ClareMcDonald](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/computerweekly/Clare-Ellen-McDonald-140px.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Clare\u00a0McDonald](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366593173/AI-and-cyber-skills-worryingly-lacking-say-business-leaders)\n- [**A bad tech job market wants good AI skills**\\\\\n\\\\\n![PatrickThibodeau](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBy: Patrick\u00a0Thibodeau](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/news/366574674/A-bad-tech-job-market-wants-good-AI-skills)\n\n[Search Networking](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/)\n\n- [What is network management?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-management)\nNetwork management is a multifaceted discipline that provides network administrators with the tools, protocols and processes to ...\n\n- [What is network downtime?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-downtime)\nNetwork downtime refers to inaccessibility to part or all of a network due to the failure of hardware, software or some ...\n\n- [What is PSTN (public switched telephone network)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/PSTN)\nPSTN (public switched telephone network) is the world's collection of interconnected voice-oriented public telephone networks via...\n\n\n[Search Security](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/)\n\n- [What is a public key and how does it work?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key)\nIn cryptography, a public key is a large numerical value that is used to encrypt data.\n\n- [What is a proxy firewall?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/proxy-firewall)\nA proxy firewall is a network security system that protects network resources by filtering messages at the application layer.\n\n- [What is a public key certificate?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/public-key-certificate)\nA public key certificate is a digitally signed document that serves to validate the sender's authorization and name.\n\n\n[Search CIO](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/)\n\n- [What is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act)\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act or GLBA), also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, is a federal law enacted in ...\n\n- [What is a CVO (chief visionary officer)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/CVO)\nThe CVO (chief visionary officer) is a newer C-suite title where the holder is expected to have a broad and comprehensive ...\n\n- [What is a balanced scorecard and how does the methodology work?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/balanced-scorecard-methodology)\nThe balanced scorecard is a management system aimed at translating an organization's strategic goals into a set of organizational...\n\n\n[Search HRSoftware](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/)\n\n- [What is employee self-service (ESS)?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/definition/employee-self-service)\nEmployee self-service (ESS) is a widely used human resources technology that enables employees to perform many job-related ...\n\n- [What is DEI?

This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of these developments, supported by facts and figures, to offer a comprehensive understanding of Meta\u2019s strategic direction and technological advancements.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nOn Wed, Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at the Meta Connect 2024 keynote to unveil a series of transformative updates and innovations. The event was a showcase of Meta\u2019s commitment to advancing augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This report will explore the key takeaways from the keynote, focusing on the Quest 3S headset, updates to Ray-Ban smart glasses, the unveiling of Orion AR glasses, and the progress of Meta AI.\n\n## **Quest 3S Headset Reveal**\n\n### **Affordable Mixed Reality Experience**\n\nOne of the most anticipated announcements was the introduction of the Quest 3S headset. Priced at $299.99 for the 128GB model and $399.99 for the 256GB model, the Quest 3S is positioned as a more affordable alternative to the Quest 3, which is priced at $499.99. The Quest 3S aims to make mixed reality experiences accessible to a broader audience by offering a lower price point without compromising on essential features.\n\n### **Technical Specifications and Features**\n\nThe Quest 3S is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and comes with 8GB of RAM. It features a resolution of 1832 x 1920 per eye, a field of view of 96 degrees horizontal and 90 degrees vertical, and a refresh rate of 120Hz. The headset supports mixed reality capabilities with a 4MP RGB passthrough, although it lacks a hardware depth sensor. The design includes lightweight construction (514g) with adjustable straps and improved face cushions for comfort. The headset also supports glasses without needing special lens inserts.\n\n### **Software and Applications**\n\nThe Quest 3S supports a range of applications, including gaming, productivity, and social interactions. It is compatible with hand-tracking and includes controllers for a more immersive experience. Users can interact with multiple floating screens and enjoy spatial audio from dual open-ear speakers. Notable software enhancements include applications like Microsoft Office, Horizon Central, and YouTube, which have been optimized for the Quest 3S.\n\n### **Market Reception and Challenges**\n\nWhile the Quest 3S has been praised for its affordability and performance, it has also faced some challenges. During a hands-on demonstration, some users reported experiencing nausea after prolonged use, particularly in immersive environments like Horizon World\u2019s Music Valley. Despite these challenges, the Quest 3S is expected to attract a wide range of users, from casual gamers to professionals seeking an affordable mixed reality solution.\n\n## **Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Updates**\n\n### **Enhanced AI Capabilities**\n\nThe Ray-Ban smart glasses received several significant updates, enhancing their functionality and user experience. One of the most notable features is the introduction of live translation capabilities, allowing users to translate conversations in real-time. This feature supports multiple languages, including Spanish, French, and Italian, making the glasses a valuable tool for travelers and multilingual users.\n\n### **Practical Applications**\n\nThe updated Ray-Ban smart glasses also include practical applications such as the ability to scan QR codes and make calls based on flyer information. Users can now take photos of what they are looking at and receive notifications later, thanks to the new \u201cReminders\u201d feature. Additionally, the glasses can remember where users parked their cars and set voice reminders for various tasks.\n\n### **Integration with Popular Services**\n\nMeta has expanded the integration of the Ray-Ban smart glasses with popular services like Spotify, Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, and Audible. Users can now listen to their favorite content through the glasses\u2019 built-in speakers and control playback using voice commands. The glasses also support sending voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger hands-free, further enhancing their utility in everyday life.\n\n### **Market Impact and Future Prospects**\n\nSince their update last year, over 700,000 pairs of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have been shipped, indicating growing interest in AI wearables. The new features and integrations are expected to drive further adoption and solidify Meta\u2019s position in the smart glasses market. The introduction of limited-edition styles, such as the Shiny Transparent Wayfarer frames, adds an element of exclusivity and fashion appeal to the product line.\n\n## **Orion AR Glasses Unveiling**\n\n### **The Most Advanced AR Glasses**\n\nMark Zuckerberg unveiled Orion, Meta\u2019s first true augmented reality glasses, describing them as \u201cthe most advanced AR glasses the world has ever seen.\u201d Orion is designed to be lightweight, weighing less than 100 grams, and features a wide field-of-view holographic display. The glasses use tiny projectors in the arms to create holograms at various depths and sizes, allowing users to interact with virtual objects overlaid on the real world.\n\n### **Cutting-Edge Technology**\n\nOrion incorporates several cutting-edge technologies, including eye and hand-tracking, voice control, and a \u201cneural interface\u201d linked to a wrist device for hands-free operation. The glasses are designed to blend digital content with the physical surroundings seamlessly, enabling multitasking, big-screen entertainment, and life-size holograms. The display architecture uses silicon-carbide to project holograms at various depths, providing an immersive AR experience.\n\n### **Initial Use and Future Vision**\n\nInitially, Orion will serve as a developer kit for internal testing and select partners, with no immediate plans for consumer availability. Zuckerberg emphasized that future versions of Orion will be more fashionable and affordable, calling the current prototype a \u201ctime machine\u201d that offers a glimpse into the future of AR technology. Meta aims to optimize display quality, reduce the form factor, and build at scale for affordability in future iterations.\n\n### **Market Potential and Challenges**\n\nThe unveiling of Orion has generated significant excitement in the AR community, with analysts suggesting that AR glasses could create new advertising opportunities and enhance customer experiences. However, the high cost and technical complexity of AR glasses remain significant challenges. Meta\u2019s focus on refining the technology and software for a mainstream launch indicates a long-term commitment to overcoming these hurdles and making AR glasses a viable consumer product.\n\n## **Meta AI Advancements**\n\n### **On Track to Become the Most Popular AI Assistant**\n\nDuring the keynote, Zuckerberg highlighted that Meta AI now boasts 500 million monthly active users and is on track to become the most popular AI assistant by the end of 2024. This growth is driven by several new features and enhancements, including voice capabilities featuring celebrity voices like Kristen Bell, John Cena, and Awkwafina. The AI assistant can now respond to voice commands, mimic celebrity voices, and provide real-time language translation.\n\n### **Llama 3.2 Model**\n\nMeta introduced the Llama 3.2 model, which features small and medium-sized vision language models (11B and 90B) and lightweight text-only models (1B and 3B). This model facilitates AI capabilities across various devices but will not be available in the European Union. The Llama 3.2 model offers enhanced functionalities compared to its predecessor, Llama 3.1, and supports multimodal capabilities, including natural voice interactions and AI-generated images.\n\n### **AI Integration Across Platforms**\n\nMeta is enhancing AI integration across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. The AI assistant can now generate images for social media feeds, provide automatic translation for short-form videos, and offer enhanced AI photo editing. These features aim to improve user engagement and make Meta\u2019s platforms more interactive and personalized.\n\n### **Accessibility Initiatives**\n\nMeta announced a partnership with the app Be My Eyes to assist visually impaired users through the smart glasses, providing real-time assistance with everyday tasks. This initiative reflects Meta\u2019s commitment to making its technologies more accessible and inclusive, ensuring that a broader range of users can benefit from AI advancements.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe Meta Connect 2024 keynote showcased significant advancements in AR, VR, and AI technologies, highlighting Meta\u2019s commitment to innovation and accessibility.

Our 2024 Responsible Business Practices Report, using 2023 data, details our progress in these pillars.\n\nThis year\u2019s report was prepared in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and informed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Internet and Media Services Industry Standards, the United Nations Global Compact and the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## Unlocking Potential for Good\n\nEmerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse represent our long-term bets on the future. In 2023, these technological pathways began to intersect in the form of products, apps and services that help bring the metaverse to life. This year\u2019s report highlights our efforts to develop these and other technologies responsibly, openly and transparently with a focus on open source innovation.\n\nIn 2023, we made strides toward our goal of building general intelligence that\u2019s accessible to all by releasing Llama, our collection of open source LLMs. We believe access to cutting-edge AI can unlock potential for individuals around the world, and are proud to report that our models have been downloaded more than 170 million times since release.\n\n## Report Highlights\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s report is unlocking potential. The report provides insights centered on our goal of creating positive change through open and transparent operations, app development and employee and partner relationships.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\n- **Providing access to cutting-edge AI** for individuals around the world through the release of Llama, our collection of open-source LLMs\n- **Launching the** [**AI Alliance**](https://thealliance.ai/) to accelerate responsible AI innovation, in collaboration with more than 50 companies and organizations\n- **Expanding parental supervision tools** globally to Facebook, Messenger and Horizon Worlds\n- **Providing the infrastructure for** [**Lantern**](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/lantern-program-protecting-children-online/), a program enabling technology companies to share signals about accounts and behaviors that violate child safety policies\n- **Becoming founding members of Take It Down**, a platform designed to help prevent young people\u2019s intimate images from spreading online\n- **Completing a Human Rights Salient Risk Assessment**, paying special attention to the rights, needs and challenges of individuals at heightened risk of becoming vulnerable or marginalized\n- **Maintaining net zero** in our global operations, and establishing a science-based emissions reduction target and decarbonization roadmap to systematically transform the way we do business\n- **Continuing to focus on building a diverse workforce** that reflects and supports our ability to serve billions of users around the globe\n\n## Further Reporting\n\nOur Responsible Business Practices Report is supplemented by in-depth reports on key areas such as human rights, sustainability and transparency, to provide a detailed overview of our business practices and progress.\n\nToday, we\u2019re launching our third annual [Human Rights Report](https://humanrights.fb.com/annual-human-rights-report/?utm_source=newsroom&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=HuRiLaunch), which reflects our commitment\u00a0 to understanding, preventing and mitigating our highest priority human rights risks. In August, we published our annual [Sustainability Report](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2024-sustainability-report/), which outlines the progress we\u2019ve made toward our net zero, climate, water, energy and supply chain goals. And we regularly publish [transparency reports](https://transparency.meta.com/reports/) to give our community visibility into how we enforce our policies, respond to data requests and protect intellectual property, while monitoring dynamics that limit access to Meta technologies.\n\nYou can read the full [Responsible Business Practices Report](https://about.meta.com/actions/responsible-business-practices/) to learn more about responsible business practices at Meta.\n\n* * *\n\nCategories\n\n:\n\n[Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technologies/meta/ )[Public Policy](https://about.fb.com/news/category/public-policy/ )[Sustainability](https://about.fb.com/news/category/sustainability/ )\n\n* * *\n\n## Related News\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

With a mission to build the future of social interaction and digital experiences, Meta's strategy encompasses several key areas. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect from Meta in the coming year, explained in simple terms:.\n\n1\\. Expanding the Metaverse\n\nThe metaverse, a virtual reality space where users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users, continues to be Meta\u2019s cornerstone. In 2024, Meta aims to make the metaverse more accessible and immersive. This includes:\n\n- Enhanced VR and AR Experiences: Meta will improve virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, making them more realistic and engaging. Expect new VR headsets and AR glasses with better graphics, sound, and user interfaces.\n- Content Creation and Collaboration: Meta plans to empower users to create and share their own virtual spaces. Think of building your own virtual hangout spot or workspace and inviting friends or colleagues to join you.\n\n2\\. Artificial Intelligence\n\n(AI) will play a crucial role in Meta\u2019s 2024 strategy. Here\u2019s how:\n\n- Personalized User Experience: Meta will use AI to better understand user preferences and tailor content to individual tastes. This means more relevant posts, ads, and suggestions in your feed.\n- Advanced Moderation Tools: AI will help detect and remove harmful content more efficiently, creating a safer online environment for users.\n\n3\\. Enhanced Privacy and Security\n\nIn response to growing concerns about data privacy, Meta is focusing on enhancing user privacy and security.\n\n- Data Protection Initiatives: Meta will introduce more robust data protection measures, giving users greater control over their personal information.\n- Transparent Policies: Expect clearer, more transparent policies regarding how Meta collects and uses data, ensuring users are fully informed and comfortable with their online presence.\n\n4\\. Social Commerce Evolution\n\nMeta is set to revolutionize social commerce, making it easier for businesses and consumers to interact and transact online.\n\n- Seamless Shopping Experience: Integration of shopping features directly into Meta\u2019s platforms (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) will make discovering and purchasing products smoother than ever.\n- Business Tools: Enhanced tools and support for small and medium-sized businesses will help them reach new customers and grow their online presence.\n\n5\\. Global Connectivity\n\nMeta\u2019s vision includes bringing the internet to more people worldwide, focusing on areas with limited access:\n\n- Connectivity Projects: Through initiatives like internet-beaming drones and satellites, Meta aims to provide affordable internet access to remote and underserved regions.\n- Educational Programs: Collaborations with local communities to offer digital literacy programs, helping more people leverage the power of the internet for education and business.\n\n6\\. Sustainability Efforts\n\nMeta is also committed to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint.\n\n- Green Data Centers: Meta will continue to invest in energy-efficient data centers powered by renewable energy.\n- Sustainable Practices: The company aims to implement eco-friendly practices across all its operations, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.\n\nMeta\u2019s strategy for 2024 is all about pushing the boundaries of technology while addressing crucial social issues like privacy, security, and global connectivity. By expanding the metaverse, integrating advanced AI, enhancing privacy protections, evolving social commerce, boosting global connectivity, and committing to sustainability, Meta is set to shape a more connected, innovative, and responsible digital future.\n\nFor those looking to stay ahead in the digital marketing field, understanding these shifts is crucial. If you're aspiring to be part of this exciting digital transformation, consider enrolling in the best digital marketing course in Kerala. This course can equip you with the latest skills and knowledge to navigate and leverage Meta\u2019s advancements effectively.

        "markdown": "\n\n# 2024 Meta Performance Marketing Summit: Innovations and Implications of Meta\u2019s Recent Advancements\n\n![](https://januarydigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-6-1024x535.png)\n\nMajor advertising platforms have released new product features and capabilities over the last few months, focusing on increasing advertisers\u2019 efficiency and equipping them with tools to better tailor their outputs, from creative to targeting. Our team recently attended Meta\u2019s Performance Marketing Summit, where we gained firsthand insights into their latest developments and how they will impact advertisers.\n\nMeta\u2019s announcements emphasized themes like the importance of data quality, the power of automation, and the evolving role of creative in targeting. They also released tools and product enhancements intended to optimize performance. Here is what advertisers and brands need to know to maximize their Meta strategies moving forward.\n\n**Key Themes**\n\n1. _Importance of Data Quality:_\u00a0In the age of automation, the algorithm is only as strong as the data that feeds it. For advertisers, this means optimizing the Conversions API integration, event-match quality, and catalog match rates to ensure that campaigns are being fueled with the highest volume and quality of data.\n2. _Automation to Drive Success:_\u00a0Meta continues to invest in physical framework and product development to support businesses and advertisers in an AI-powered future. Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns and Advantage+ App Campaigns are one of the most impactful tools that an advertiser can use to drive performance on the Meta platforms, contributing to a +32% increase in ROAS on average.\n3. _Creative is the New Targeting_: The algorithm uses creative inputs to identify and reach new users, driving serendipitous discovery and taking the guesswork out of targeting. Successful creative sets are visually diverse, platform-native, and provide value to the user. This allows the algorithm to reach more users with higher relevancy and less creative fatigue, driving higher impact for advertisers.\n4. _Tailor Video for Reels_: Video consumption continues to grow, now making up over 60% of time spent across Facebook and Instagram. This is largely driven by the Reels placement, which now makes up over 60% of time spent on Instagram. The likelihood of an ad serving in the Reels placement doubles when the asset Is built to meet the 3 creative essentials \u2013 vertical 9:16 specifications, audio for sound-on consumption, and with key information confined to the safe zone.\n5. _AI as a Creative Development Tool:_\u00a0With high volumes of diverse creative needed to drive performance, Meta continues to develop and launch tools to help advertisers use AI to fill this need. This currently includes image enhancement, text generation, background generation, and more through the always-evolving Advantage+ Creative suite of products. In the future, this is expected to expand to include prompt-based text and image generation, shifting the way creative teams approach asset development. While creative will be automated, creativity will not be.\n6. _Testing is Critical:_\u00a0Measuring success has never been more important, or complex. No individual measurement source or methodology is perfect, so advertisers should adopt a 360-degree approach to measurement. Using multiple measurement sources in a connected framework allows brands to track all components of a marketing strategy. Controlled, structured experiments (such as A/B tests and lift tests) are critical to measure causality and incrementality. Organizations that invest in measurement are 44% more likely to exceed revenue goals, and Meta advertisers that run 15 experiments in a year see 45% higher ad performance.\n\n\n**New Product Focuses**\n\n- _Reminder Ads:_ This ad feature allows advertisers to re-engage with people who have already expressed interest in their products or services but haven\u2019t made a purchase yet. They remind potential customers about the product or service they viewed, prompting them to take action. This approach helps businesses stay top of mind and drive conversions by targeting warm leads with personalized messages tailored to their previous interactions.\n- _Promotion Highlights:_\u00a0This tool highlights promotion codes that are available, either by sourcing them automatically from an advertiser site, or via manual input. When consumers are driven to site with these ads, the promo code can be automatically applied or easily copy-pasted to be applied at checkout.\n- _Product Level Video for Advantage+ Catalog Ads:_\u00a0Videos will be able to be uploaded directly into the catalog at the product or SKU level for increased ad volume, diversity, and relevance.\n- _Budget Scheduling:_\u00a0This tool allows advertisers to plan budget surges in advance and is ideal for promotions or other peak sales periods. By priming the algorithm with the budget change data in advance, programs will be less impacted by the algorithmic learning phase.\n- _More Customizations in Advantage+ Creative Enhancements:_\u00a0Additional creative levers will continue to roll out, with new controls over text, color, backgrounds, and more.\n- _Creator Marketplace Enhancements:_\u00a0Machine learning fuels new tools to recommend creators that brands should consider for partnership.\n- _Product Level Boosting:_(In Alpha Testing) Solution that will enable advertisers to apply a multiplier within the catalog to amplify service of specific products across catalog ads.\n\n\nRemaining up-to-date with these advancements is crucial for advertisers seeking to leverage Meta\u2019s platforms effectively. The integration of high-quality data, automation, and creative tools will be pivotal in driving performance. Our team is committed to continuous learning and adaptation in this dynamic landscape. As Meta continues to innovate, advertisers must remain agile and informed to maximize their impact.\n\n[Previous](https://januarydigital.com/how-brands-can-prepare-for-prime-day-this-july/)\n\n[Next](https://januarydigital.com/back-to-school-2024/)\n\nShare the Post:\n\n### Related Posts\n\n[![google](https://januarydigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-1.29.28\u202fPM.png)](https://januarydigital.com/google-holiday-report-2024/)\n\n#### [Google\u2019s Holiday Report: Cyber Week Wins and Last Minute Momentum](https://januarydigital.com/google-holiday-report-2024/)\n\n[![shopping mall](https://januarydigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-1.25.19\u202fPM.png)](https://januarydigital.com/cyber-12-2024-recap/)\n\n#### [Cyber 12 2024 Performance Recap](https://januarydigital.com/cyber-12-2024-recap/)\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-RLG5P1WBD2&gacid=1081034378.1736414373&gtm=45je5170v9123724814z89191584186za200zb9191584186&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=101925629~102067555~102067808~102081485~102198178&z=736291692)",

We started the year by introducing [Llama 3](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/), the next generation of our state-of-the-art open large language model. We followed that in July with [Llama 3.1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/), which included the release of 405B, the first frontier-level open AI model. Keeping up the pace of innovation, we announced [Llama 3.2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/) at Connect 2024, sharing our first ever multimodal models, as well as small and medium-sized and lightweight, text-only models that fit onto edge and mobile devices. And to close out the year, we released [Llama 3.3 70B](https://www.llama.com/), a text-only model that offers similar performance as the 3.1 405B at a fraction of the serving cost.\n\nAs [Meta Founder & CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDPm9gqv2cW/), Llama has quickly become the most adopted model, with more than 650 million downloads of Llama and its derivatives, [twice as many downloads](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-usage-doubled-may-through-july-2024/) as we had three months ago. Putting that in perspective, Llama models have now been downloaded an average of one million times a day since our first release in February 2023.\n\nMeeting the growing demand for Llama would not be possible without the roster of partners we have across the hardware and software ecosystem, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), AMD, Microsoft\u2019s Azure, Databricks, Dell, Google Cloud, Groq, NVIDIA, IBM watsonx, Oracle Cloud, ScaleAI, Snowflake, and more. This growing set of partners represents the best of the AI technology ecosystem and ensures Llama is optimized to run in virtually any environment and in any form, including on-device and on-premises, as well as managed service APIs from our cloud partners. Llama usage by monthly token volume has continued to make tremendous progress, with monthly token volume on key cloud partners growing over 50% month-over-month in September.\n\nOutside of the US, Llama became a global phenomenon this year, with impressive growth and appetite for our models from developers around the world and a hastened pace of adoption with the launch of our Llama 3 model collection. Llama license approvals have more than doubled in the last six months overall, with notable growth in emerging markets and downloads surging across Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region, and Europe.\n\nBeyond the high demand for Llama, we\u2019ve been excited to see the success our partners have had this year by iterating on our work. The open source community has published more than 85,000 Llama derivatives on Hugging Face alone\u2014an increase of over 5x than at the start of the year. This engagement and contributions from the community have helped fuel product decisions at Meta that better inform our next wave of foundational models and features to release within Meta AI\u2014and ultimately back to the community.\n\nGrowing adoption by enterprises and governments\n\nAs more people turn to our open models, we\u2019ve released new features that make building on Llama a more standardized experience. This year, we developed [Llama Stack](https://www.llama.com/#llama-stack), an interface for canonical toolchain components to customize Llama models and build agentic applications. We believe that offering the best simplified tool for building with Llama will only accelerate the incredible adoption we\u2019ve already witnessed across sectors.\n\nBuilding on our track record of partnering to advance open AI innovation, we [worked with IBM](https://ai.meta.com/blog/ibm-watsonx-ai-llama/) to offer Llama as part of its [watsonx.AI model catalog](http://watsonx.ai/), a next-generation enterprise studio for AI builders worldwide to train, validate, tune, and deploy AI models. This partnership with IBM means Llama is already being used by local governments, major telecommunications companies, and even by a professional soccer team to help identify potential new recruits.\n\n[Block](https://block.xyz/) is integrating Llama into the customer support systems behind Cash App. Because Llama is open source, the company can rapidly experiment and customize the model to each of their use cases, while also allowing them to preserve the privacy of their customer data.\n\n[Accenture](https://ai.meta.com/blog/accenture-built-with-llama/) turned to Llama in 2024 when it received a request from a leading intergovernmental body to create a chatbot that would be the organization\u2019s first large-scale, public facing generative AI application. Built with Llama 3.1, the chatbot operates on AWS and employs various tools and services during customization and inference to ensure scalability and robustness.\n\n[Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/2024/12/contextualized-recommendations-through-personalized-narratives-using-llms/) uses Llama to help deliver contextualized recommendations to boost artist discovery and create an even richer user experience. By combining Llama\u2019s broad world knowledge and versatility with Spotify\u2019s deep expertise in audio content, Spotify has created explanations that offer users personalized insights into their recommended content. The team has also created a way for its subscribers to receive personalized narratives about recommended new releases and culturally relevant commentary from their English and Spanish-speaking AI DJs.\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/open-source/liger-kernel-open-source-ecosystem-for-efficient-llm-training) recently shared Liger-Kernel, an open source library designed to enable more efficient training of LLMs. Building on this scalable infrastructure, LinkedIn explored a variety of LLMs to fine-tune for tasks specific to their social network. For some applications, they found that Llama achieved comparable or better quality compared to state-of-the-art commercial foundational models\u2014and at significantly lower costs and latencies.\n\nAs open models continue to improve at unprecedented speed\u2014and in some cases are already exceeding closed models across certain capabilities\u20142024 was the year that saw many enterprise users making the switch. This year, we saw momentum on AWS with customers who were seeking choice, customization, and cost efficiency turning to Llama to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. In one case, [Arcee AI](http://arcee.ai/) enabled its customers to fine-tune Llama models on their data, resulting in a 47% reduction in total cost of ownership compared to closed LLMs.\n\nBeyond enterprises, demand for Llama from governments around the world also grew. This year, we [worked to make Llama available](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/open-source-ai-america-global-security/) for use to the US government. Due to the ability of large language models to process vast amounts of data, reason, and generate usable insights, they\u2019re positioned to help drive efficiency and help government workers improve delivery of public services. In India, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is building on Llama with the goal of offering enhanced learning outcomes and student support, while in Argentina, the government recently announced it will optimize national public services delivery through the use of a WhatsApp chatbot built with Llama.\n\nThe world's most accessible AI assistant and a new class of social experiences\n\nThe rapid drumbeat of model innovation we\u2019ve delivered over the past year is also having a ripple effect in our products. Built with Llama, [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/meta-ai/) is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of 2024 with almost 600 million monthly active users.\n\nThis year, we expanded access to Meta AI to more countries and in new languages across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, and on the web. By the end of this year, we anticipate that Meta AI will be available in 43 countries and a dozen languages, and we look forward to bringing the assistant to more people and places.\n\nOn WhatsApp, we continue to see promising signs of retention and engagement, which have coincided with India and Mexico becoming two of our largest markets for Meta AI usage. There are also signs Meta AI is helping people to use our apps in new ways, whether they\u2019re sharing images with Meta AI to learn about the world around them or using the assistant as a coach to help unlock their goals.\n\nIn July, we launched [AI Studio](https://ai.meta.com/ai-studio/), which has become the go-to destination for creators to make AIs that help them connect with their audiences in fun and useful new ways. Since we launched, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of thousands of AIs created, offering cooking tips, memes, affirmations, and more. We recently expanded access to AI characters in more countries and languages, including India, Pakistan, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile. In 2025, our goal is for AI Studio to be the world\u2019s leading destination for AI character creation.\n\nOn our hugely popular Ray-Ban Meta glasses, a custom Llama model enables Meta AI to help people get the information they need without ever having to pick up a smartphone. Last month, we announced that Meta AI is rolling out on Ray-Ban Meta glasses in France, Italy, Ireland, and Spain, giving more people the opportunity to get things done, feel inspired, and connect with people and things that they care about\u2014right from their glasses.\n\nAnd across our platforms, Llama is also helping businesses through our [Advantage+ Creative text generation ad tool](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Introducing-Enhanced-Gen-AI-Features-and-Other-Tools-to-Help-Build-Your-Business) to create text variations at scale, while additional models are enabling [Advantage+ Creative video and image generation](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Unlock-Video-Performance-with-GenAI-and-Creator-Marketing), which help businesses to create eye-catching ads to help reach the right audience. Many advertisers are seeing strong results heading into the holiday season.

Llama 4 will have multiple releases, driving major advancements across the board and enabling a host of new product innovation in areas like speech and reasoning.\n\nWe believe AI experiences will increasingly move away from text and become voice-based as speech models become more natural, conversational, and, most importantly, helpful. We [introduced voice for Meta AI this past fall](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/metas-ai-product-news-connect/) across our apps and have significant plans to advance these capabilities in the first half of next year to provide our AI products with more utility and capability for consumers across our apps and devices.\n\nIn October we announced [Meta Movie Gen](https://ai.meta.com/research/movie-gen/), our breakthrough set of research models for AI video generation and editing. We see incredible new possibilities to bring these experiences to our apps, lowering barriers to entry and raising the ceiling for what\u2019s possible to create and edit with AI video.\n\nWe also see significant opportunities next year for the creation of agentic AI systems with advanced reasoning. We\u2019re testing business agents that can talk to customers, provide support, and facilitate commerce, and we\u2019re encouraged by the interest we\u2019re seeing on our own messaging platforms. We see these agentic systems also having benefits for consumers as we look to make AI assistants that are more task-oriented and can do things on your behalf, moving from a virtual to personal experience.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to continue the momentum we\u2019ve sparked as we move into the new year. We\u2019ll continue to rapidly innovate and share Llama updates that will enable more people to build with the most capable technology to date, along with a rapidly iterating and evolving set of products. All of this work continues to support our ultimate goal of building the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\n\n* * *\n\nWritten by:\n\nAhmad Al-Dahle\n\nVP,

mins\n\nShare\n\n![](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/138/a48721035dccdccd75fa8cdc0ff30d75:2338bc8a95f187440252e4b568a770a2/meta-1.webp)\n\nMeta\u2019s new AI model can check that other AI models' work\n\nMeta\u2019s AI model advances AI assessment, reduces human intervention and progresses autonomous AI development that promises efficiency gains for businesses\n\nThe field of AI has experienced rapid growth and innovation in recent years, with [tech companies worldwide competing to develop more advanced and efficient AI models](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/meta-ramping-up-ai-efforts-expanding-gpu-capacity).\n\nThese models, which are complex computer programs designed to process and analyse data, have applications across various industries, from healthcare to finance.\n\nAs AI technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, researchers are exploring ways to make the development process more autonomous and less reliant on human intervention.\n\nYet one of the [challenges in AI development is the need for extensive human oversight](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/global-ai-ethics-bridging-cultural-divides-in-technology) to evaluate and refine AI models.\n\nThis process, known as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often requires input from specialised human annotators to verify the accuracy of AI-generated responses, particularly for complex tasks in areas such as science, mathematics and coding.\n\nYet the reliance on human feedback can be time-consuming and costly, potentially slowing down the pace of AI innovation.\n\n[Meta, the technology company formerly known as Facebook](https://technologymagazine.com/digital-transformation/meta-turns-20-ai-innovation-transparency-and-the-metaverse), has made a significant stride in addressing this challenge.\n\nThe company, which operates social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has released a new AI model through its research division that could potentially reduce the need for human involvement in the AI development process.\n\n## Self-taught evaluator: a step towards autonomous AI\n\nMeta's latest AI offering, called the \"Self-Taught Evaluator\", represents a novel approach to AI model assessment.\n\nAccording to the company, this tool utilises a technique known as \"chain of thought\" to make reliable judgements about the responses generated by other AI models.\n\nThis technique, which involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, logical steps, has been shown to improve the accuracy of AI responses in challenging subject areas such as science, coding and mathematics.\n\nMeta\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg\n\nThe [CEO of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/meta-unveils-latest-ai-chip-as-it-races-to-gen-ai-ambitions) says:\n\n> \u201cOur long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly and make it widely available so everyone can benefit.\u201d\n\nReuters reports that Meta's researchers trained the Self-Taught Evaluator model using entirely AI-generated data, eliminating the need for human input at the training stage.\n\nThis approach differs from the traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) method, which relies heavily on human annotators to label data and verify the accuracy of AI-generated responses.\n\nJason Weston, one of the researchers involved in the project, explained the potential implications of this development: \"We hope, as AI becomes more and more super-human, that it will get better and better at checking its work, so that it will actually be better than the average human.\n\n\u201cThe idea of being self-taught and able to self-evaluate is basically crucial to the idea of getting to this sort of super-human level of AI.\"\n\n## Industry trends and future implications\n\nMeta's release of the Self-Taught Evaluator model aligns with a broader industry trend towards more autonomous AI systems.\n\nOther major technology companies, including Google and Anthropic, have also published research on similar concepts, referred to as Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF).\n\nHowever, Meta's approach may stand out due to the company's decision to release its models for public use.\n\nThis open approach contrasts with the practices of some competitors, who often keep their advanced AI models proprietary.\n\n![Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AW29KofK2j4/hqdefault.jpg)\n\nThe potential for AI models to evaluate and improve themselves without human intervention could have far-reaching implications for the field of AI.\n\nIt may pave the way for the development of autonomous AI agents capable of learning from their own mistakes and carrying out a wide array of tasks independently.\n\nAdditionally, alongside the Self-Taught Evaluator, Meta has announced the release of several other AI tools.\n\nThese include an update to the company's image-identification Segment Anything model, a tool designed to accelerate the response generation times of large language models (LLMs) and datasets intended to aid in the discovery of new inorganic materials.\n\nAs these technologies continue to mature, they show promise on how to revolutionise businesses' approach to AI development, quality control and system reliability at scale.\n\n_\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\*\\*\\*_\n\n_Make sure you check out the latest

Meta AI was on track to become the world\u2019s most popular AI assistant before the end of 2024. The tool currently has 600 million monthly users. Meta\u2019s open-source AI model, Llama and its derivatives, have been downloaded more than 650 million times.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of innovations that we would not have had the idea of, or we didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to do, that people have done because they have the Llama system in their hands,\u201d Yann LeCun, Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist, said. \u201cThey were able experiment with it and come up with new ideas.\u201d\n\nLeCun\u2019s comments came during a recent conversation with veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher for [her podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-with-kara-swisher/id1643307527) held at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center as part of the [Discovery Series.](https://washingtondc.jhu.edu/events/series-forums/discovery-series/)\n\nHere are three things to know about how Meta and LeCun approach AI:\n\n1. **Why Meta made Llama open source**\n\nUnlike Anthropic and OpenAI, Meta publicly shared the algorithm behind Llama, although it has not disclosed the data set used to train the AI tool. Companies including Accenture, IBM, and Spotify are now using Llama to enhance their operations.\n\nMeta did not release an open-source version of the first iteration of Llama, and LeCun said the company received several requests for one. Since then, it has release multiple open-source versions.\n\n\u201cIt allows you to run the system and also fine tune it however you want,\u201d LeCun explained. He added that Meta thinks the platform will advance faster with more people using it.\n\n2. **LeCun thinks AI fears are overblown**\n\nLeCun has emerged as a leading critic of proposed AI regulations, arguing that limiting research and development will slow innovation.\n\n\u201cRegulating \\[R&D\\] is extremely counterproductive. It\u2019s based on false ideas about the potential dangers of AI,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proposals that have existed have would have resulted in regulatory capture by a small number of companies.\u201d\n\nLeCun offered pointed criticism of legislation that requires authorization based on a computer\u2019s processing speed.\n\n\u201cThere are important questions about AI safety that need to be discussed,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a limit of computation just makes no sense.\u201d\n\n3. **Robots \u201ccan\u2019t understand the physical world\u201d**\n\nLeCun said we\u2019re still years away from AI taking on physical tasks, such as cleaning.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because we can\u2019t build the robots. We just cannot make them smart enough.\u201d\n\nThe physical world is much harder to decode than language, he explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive for humans to think that; \u2026 we think language is the pinnacle of intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually simple because it\u2019s, you know, just a sequence of discrete symbols we can handle.\u201d\n\nSearch for:Search\n\n### Quick Links:\n\n- [Stay Connected](https://washingtondc.jhu.edu/stay-connected/)\n- [Events](https://washingtondc.jhu.edu/events/)\n- [News & Media](https://washingtondc.jhu.edu/news-media/)\n\nClose",

Meta's stock price hit a record on Dec. 11.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tries on Orion AR glasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 25, 2024. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\n\nManuel Orbegozo \\| Reuters\n\n\"Aut Zuck Aut Nihil\" spanned the front of Mark Zuckerberg's loose-fitting black shirt during his keynote at Meta's Connect event in September.\n\nThe words, donned in all-caps and gray font, were a play on the Latin phrase \"Aut Caesar Aut Nihil,\" which translates to \"Either Caesar or nothing\" or rather \"All or nothing.\" It was a fitting phrase for a company that in 2024 put the full weight of its resources behind its artificial intelligence strategy.\n\nMeta in April said it would [raise its spending levels](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-loses-200-billion-in-value-zuckerberg-focuses-on-ai-metaverse.html) in 2024 by as much as $10 billion to support infrastructure investments for its AI efforts. Although the announcement [sent shares plunging](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-meta-q1-2024-earnings-.html) as much as 19% that evening, investors have come around to the company's costly AI ambitions. Meta's stock price hit a [record](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/alphabet-and-tesla-reach-fresh-records-joining-amazon-and-meta-.html) on Dec. 11, and it's up nearly 70% year to date as of the market's close on Friday.\n\n\"It's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there,\" [Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) said on a call with analysts in October.\n\nHe noted AI's \"positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work,\" highlighting how the technology was key to rebuilding the company's online advertising business that took a lashing from [Apple](/quotes/AAPL/)'s iOS privacy update in 2021. Additionally, he said AI underpins Meta's more nascent projects, such as its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and experimental [Orion augmented reality headset](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/meta-finally-finds-success-in-ar-vr-three-years-after-changing-name.html) that Zuckerberg believes could represent \"the next computing platform.\"\n\nZuckerberg's comments about AI underscore how the technology has become Meta's top priority, directly impacting the company's business and potentially paving the way for future revenue opportunities. Unlike the company's more conventional services, like Instagram and Facebook, AI is an infrastructure technology that Zuckerberg wants hardwired into its various products, particularly as competitors like OpenAI continue to make inroads with consumers.\n\nWhile OpenAI's GPT family of AI models help power apps like ChatGPT, Meta's [family of Llama AI models](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/metas-open-source-approach-to-ai-puzzles-wall-street-techies-love-it.html) feeds the company's newer generative AI features like the Meta AI digital assistant. That chatbot represents Zuckerberg's primary way to introduce generative AI technologies to its billions of users.\n\n\"Meta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year,\" Zuckerberg said at Connect.\n\nThe company has been increasingly releasing new generative AI features for advertisers to continue improving the efficiency of its online advertising platform. And with the hiring last month of Clara Shih, who had been [Salesforce's](/quotes/CRM/) CEO of AI, to lead a new business AI group, Meta aims to build a more enterprise-focused unit in the new year.\n\nThe Meta AI logo is being displayed on a smartphone in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on June 10, 2024.\n\nJonathan Raa \\| Nurphoto \\| Getty Images\n\nMeta's all-encompassing approach to AI has led analysts to predict that Meta is positioned for more success in 2025.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies chose Meta as one of generative AI's \"winners\" heading into 2025, writing in a Dec. 15 note that the company's massive user base represents \"one of the richest surfaces to introduce Gen AI tools.\" Truist Securities analysts said in a note last week that the Meta AI digital assistant could challenge Google's search as \"an answer engine for all kinds of queries\" and that the social media company is likely to outperform in 2025, potentially benefiting from offering businesses more advanced customer service chatbots.\n\n\"We believe META has a unique opportunity to introduce Gen AI tools to the almost 4B users & >200M businesses across its family of apps,\" the Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nMeta declined to comment for this article, but pointed to previous statistics and executive comments about AI.\n\n## Meta AI's expanding user base\n\nMeta has been increasingly talking up the number of people who use Meta AI, with Zuckerberg saying in December that the digital assistant \"now has nearly 600 million monthly actives.\"\n\nHe launched the Meta AI chatbot in 2023 to rival the generative AI chatbots of competitors, most notably OpenAI's ChatGPT. In April, the company brought it to the forefront of each of the apps in its empire by putting Meta AI in the search bars of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nBut because the company doesn't offer a stand-alone Meta AI app, it's difficult to directly compare its usage to similar services like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, said David Curry, the data editor for insights firm Business of Apps.\n\nWhen it comes to monthly active users, the most popular of these generative AI chatbot apps is ChatGPT by a wide margin, followed by [Google](/quotes/GOOGL/) Gemini, [Microsoft](/quotes/MSFT/) Copilot, Claude and Perplexity, Curry said.\n\nThe Meta AI \"standalone website gets less than 10 million views per month, putting it far below the major services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) and even lower than some mid-range players like Anthropic,\" Curry said, based on data he accessed via the Similarweb web-tracking service.\n\nMeta's finance chief, Susan Li, [told](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/META-Q2-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf) analysts in July that India has become the company's \"largest market for Meta AI usage.\" That usage has coincided with promising signs of [retention and engagement on WhatsApp](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/metas-whatsapp-is-chasing-big-businesses-to-capitalize-on-popularity.html), Li added.\n\nTourists are seen at the forecourt of the iconic Gateway of India as a digital display of messaging app WhatsApp is displayed, in Mumbai on August 25, 2023.\n\nIndranil Mukherjee \\| AFP \\| Getty Images\n\nAmong those users is Sonny Ravan,a music producer in Pune, India. Ravan said he finds Meta AI, which he uses through WhatsApp, helpful for learning about the history of songs that he enjoys. He also uses it as a tool to learn about people in the music industry who he plans to work with or meet, describing it as great for preparation.\n\nSathish Thiyagarajan, 30, a technical support engineer for marketing tech firm GoX.AI, said he's increasingly using Meta AI as a search tool via WhatsApp, which he noted dominates the Indian market for mobile internet communications.\n\n\"While I'm talking with my family or my friends, if they're saying something to me and I have to search something, I'm not going to go to Google,\" said Thiyagarajan, of Chennai, India. \"I'm just going to put the phone in the speaker mode, and I'll immediately search through Meta AI.\"\n\nHowever, Thiyagarajan said he only uses Meta AI when he's on his phone. If he's at his computer, OpenAI's ChatGPT is his preferred AI chatbot.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of Meta AI's bundling into WhatsApp's search functions.\n\nJawhar Sircar, 72 **,** a retired government official in Kolkata, India, called the Meta AI search feature in WhatsApp \"quite a nuisance.\" That's because whenever a user pauses while typing out a name in the search-find box, the Meta AI technology quickly \"picks up whatever has been typed\" and generates what he describes as unnecessary search prompt suggestions.\n\nAs far as the popularity of Meta AI in India, Sircar said he thinks the feature is mostly used by companies, technologists and other professionals who \"are getting hooked to AI\" alongside the Indian government's continued investment in regional computing infrastructure.\n\n\"Professionals and companies have started using AI, but the general user has no need, at least not on the Meta platforms,\" Sircar wrote in an email.\n\n## Meta's AI strategy for advertisers\n\nAdvertising is still the key to revenue.\n\nMeta\u00a0[said](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/02/production-engineering/meta-andromeda-advantage-automation-next-gen-personalized-ads-retrieval-engine/)\u00a0in December that over 1 million advertisers had used the company's GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in a single month.\n\n\"We estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a +7% increase in conversions,\" Meta said at the time, regarding its image generation features.\n\nWhile people may [associate generative AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/08/how-the-generative-ai-boom-could-forever-change-online-advertising.html) with the visually striking and sometimes surreal imagery derived from popular services like Dall-E or Midjourney, it's more likely that the average small business advertiser uses Meta's GenAI tools for more subtle tasks, said Stacy Reed, an online advertising and Facebook ads consultant.\n\nThat includes using AI to create multiple versions of an ad's headline, auto-resizing the size of ads so they look appropriate within users' Instagram and Facebook apps, and repositioning certain images within the ads so that the promotions perform better, Reed said.\n\nAdvertisers that already write strong, creative copy can ask Meta's GenAI tools for \"a little bit more\" help, Reed said.\n\n\"That's where you win with their AI tools,\" she said.\n\nReed said the many small advertisers she supports aren't associating the new features with AI. They \"think that Meta is just enhancing the way you build ads,\" Reed said.\n\n![How Meta's $19 billion bet on WhatsApp could finally start paying off](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107294825-1693541615805-GettyImages-1001511110.jpg?v=1694771657&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:0610:06\n\nHow Meta's $19 billion bet on WhatsApp could finally start paying off\n\n[Tech](https://www.cnbc.com/technology/)\n\nCelina Guerrero, an independent corporate sales and training consultant, said she uses Meta's GenAI tools to help with writing headlines for her ads, but she said she finds Meta's advertising interface to be confusing and constantly changing.\n\n\"It is visually overwhelming from a user experience,\" Guerrero said.\n\nAhead of a Facebook ad campaign planned for January, Guerrero said she is debating how to use Meta's GenAI tools for more in-depth tasks, like modifying her ad's entire in-line copy.\n\n\"I don't want my copy to sound like ChatGPT,\" Guerrero said, referring to the sterile, run-of-the-mill AI-generated text that's proliferating the web. \"I have two options: One, I don't use the variations, or two, I spend an inordinate amount of hours editing it.\"\n\nMost big companies and advertising agencies are turning to more marketing-specific tools for their generative AI-based ad campaigns, said Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester. Those services are more robust than Meta's built-in AI ad tools, he said.\n\nStill, the mere introduction of simple GenAI tools is beneficial to Metaconsidering it dominates the digital ads market along with Google. Meta's generative AI tools just have \"to be good enough to squeeze out more investment\" from advertisers, said Maurice Rahmey, CEO of performance marketing firm Disruptive Digital and a former Facebook customer manager.\n\n\"It's better for their business, even if it's just those small, incremental changes,\" Rahmey said \"It's a business of scale.\"\n\nClara Shih, Former CEO of Salesforce AI\n\nBloomberg \\| Bloomberg \\| Getty Images\n\n## What's next for Meta's enterprise play?\n\nWith Meta's hiring of Shih from Salesforce in November, some analysts say Meta could make an enterprise technology push with its [Llama family of open-source AI models](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/metas-open-source-approach-to-ai-puzzles-wall-street-techies-love-it.html).\n\nLlama's advancements \"represent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers,\" Meta monetization head John Hegeman said in a statement.\n\nShih, who was one of [CNBC's 2024 changemakers](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/clara-shih-cnbc-changemakers.html), rejoined Salesforce in 2020 after previously working at the company from 2006 through 2009. As part of her most recent role at Salesforce, Shih helped oversee Einstein GPT for Service and Sales, a GenAI product intended for sales and customer support staff.\n\nDuring her first stint at Salesforce, Shih created a business app that let users connect their Salesforce customer relationship software with their Facebook connections. In 2009, she wrote \"The Facebook Era,\" a book intended for professionals to better understand how to use social networks for business.\n\nMultiple former Meta AI and product leaders told CNBC that Shih's vast experience will be helpful considering the company has failed in previous attempts at building enterprise software.\n\nMeta [announced](https://www.facebook.com/help/1167689491269151/) in May that it plans to shut down Workplace, its business communications product, by 2026. And after buying enterprise startup Kustomer for about $1 billion in 2020, Meta spun it out in 2023 in a deal that was [reportedly](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-strikes-deal-to-divest-itself-of-kustomer-8e945431) valued at $250 million.\n\nThe most logical step for Meta would be to create a [larger business around WhatsApp](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/metas-whatsapp-is-chasing-big-businesses-to-capitalize-on-popularity.html), said Ralph Schackart, an internet equity analyst at investment bank William Blair. Specifically, WhatsApp could help businesses build customer-service chatbots using Meta's GenAI, Schackart said.\n\n\"Longer term, this is going to evolve into customized sales agents, which is a $3 trillion-plus industry,\" Schackart said about Meta's WhatsApp business AI chatbot opportunity.\n\n**WATCH**: [If the U.S. bans TikTok, China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/12/06/if-the-u-s-bans-tiktok-china-could-retaliate-and-target-tesla-and-apple-deepwaters-gene-munster.html).\n\n![If the U.S. bans TikTok China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple: Deepwater's Gene Munster](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108072817-17335249551733524950-37440314808-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1733524953&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:2304:23\n\nIf the U.S. bans TikTok China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple: Deepwater's Gene Munster\n\n[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fastmoney/)",

Our team was thrilled to have a chance to attend this event, which showcased the latest in gaming and gave us a glimpse into the future of the industry. Gamescom 2024 was a record-breaking conference, with over 335,000 guests from about 120 nations, making it one of the world\u2019s largest and most international gaming gatherings. This year\u2019s showcase had a considerable rise in attendance \u2014 nearly 15,000 people over the previous year. Gamescom 2024 introduced new hardware advances used for the next generation of video games. Improvements in CPUs and video cards, particularly from big companies in the industry like AMD and NVIDIA, are pushing the boundaries of what is feasible for games in terms of performance and graphics. For example, NVIDIA introduced the forthcoming GeForce RTX series, which promises unprecedented levels of immersion and realism. Not to be outdone, AMD has introduced a new series of Ryzen processors designed to survive the most extreme gaming settings. These technological advancements are critical as they allow video game developers to create more complex and visually stunning games, particularly for virtual reality. As processing power increases, virtual reality is reaching new heights. We saw numerous VR-capable games at Gamescom that offer players an unparalleled level of immersion. Being a VR/AR development company, we were excited to watch how technology was evolving and what new possibilities it was bringing up. The video game called \u201cHalf-Life: Alyx\u201d has set a new standard, and it\u2019s clear that VR is no longer a niche but a growing segment of the gaming market. Gamescom\u2019s format proved its strength, as indicated by the fact that its two days were run in two formats. Gamescom stands out from other games exhibitions or conventions by being both a business and consumer show. This dual format enables the developers to collect feedback on their products immediately. This is especially so when meeting prospective clients during a presentation or when giving a demonstration to gamers, the response elicited is very helpful. Rarely does anyone get a chance to witness the actual implementation and real-world effect of what they have done.](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/gamescom-2024-the-future-of-gaming-is-here-and-its-bigger-than-ever/)\n\n[![](https://www.qualium-systems.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-to-Use-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Creating-Content-for-RPG-Games-blog.png)](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/how-to-use-artificial-intelligence-in-creating-content-for-rpg-games/)\n\n[Devlog](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/devlog/)\n\nSeptember 2, 2024\n\n[How to Use Artificial Intelligence in Creating Content for RPG Games](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/how-to-use-artificial-intelligence-in-creating-content-for-rpg-games/)\n\n[Introduction The World of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Its Application in Content Creation for RPG Games Recently, the world of IT technology has been actively filled with various iterations of artificial intelligence. From advanced chatbots that provide technical support to complex algorithms aiding doctors in disease diagnosis, AI\u2019s presence is increasingly felt. In a few years, it might be hard to imagine our daily activities without artificial intelligence, especially in the IT sector. Let\u2019s focus on generative artificial intelligence, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others, which have long held an important place in software development. However, special attention should be given to the application of AI in the video game industry. We see AI being used from voice generation to real-time responses. Admittedly, this area is not yet so developed as to be widely implemented in commercially available games. But the main emphasis I want to make is on the creation and enhancement of game content using AI. In my opinion, this is the most promising and useful direction for game developers. The Lack of Resources in Creating Large and Ambitious RPG Games and How AI Can Be a Solution In the world of indie game development, a field with which I am closely familiar, the scarcity of resources, especially time and money, is always a foremost challenge. While artificial intelligence (AI) cannot yet generate money or add extra hours to the day (heh-heh), it can be the key to effectively addressing some of these issues. Realism here is crucial. We understand that AI cannot write an engaging story or develop unique gameplay mechanics \u2013 these aspects remain the domain of humans (yes, game designers and other creators can breathe easy for now). However, where AI can truly excel is in generating various items, enhancing ideas, writing coherent texts, correcting errors, and similar tasks. With such capabilities, AI can significantly boost the productivity of each member of an indie team, freeing up time for more creative and unique tasks, from content generation to quest structuring. What is Artificial Intelligence and How Can it be Used in Game Development For effective use of AI in game development, a deep understanding of its working principles is essential. Artificial intelligence is primarily based on complex mathematical models and algorithms that enable machines to learn, analyze data, and make decisions based on this data. This could be machine learning, where algorithms learn from data over time becoming more accurate and efficient, or deep learning, which uses neural networks to mimic the human brain. Let\u2019s examine the main types of AI Narrative AI (OpenAI ChatGPT, Google BERT): Capable of generating stories, dialogues, and scripts. Suitable for creating the foundations of the game world and dialogues. Analytical AI (IBM Watson, Palantir Technologies): Focuses on data collection and analysis. Used for optimizing game processes and balance. Creative AI (Adobe Photoshop\u2019s Neural Filters, Runway ML): Able to create visual content such as textures, character models, and environments. Generative AI (OpenAI DALL-E, GPT-3 and GPT-4 from OpenAI): Ideal for generating unique names, item descriptions, quest variability, and other content. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each type of AI, developers can use them more effectively in their work. For example, using AI to generate original stories or quests can be challenging, but using it for correcting grammatical errors or generating unique names and item descriptions is more realistic and beneficial. This allows content creators to focus on more creative aspects of development, optimizing their time and resources. An Overview of the Characteristics of Large Fantasy RPG Games and Their Content Requirements In large fantasy RPG games, not only gameplay and concept play a pivotal role, but also the richness and variability of content \u2013 spells, quests, items, etc. This diversity encourages players to immerse themselves in the game world, sometimes spending hundreds of hours exploring every nook and cranny. The quantity of this content is important, but so is its quality. Imagine, we offer the player a relic named \u201cGreat Heart\u201d with over 100 attribute variations \u2013 that\u2019s one approach. But if we offer 100 different relics, each with a unique name and 3-4 variations in description, the player\u2019s experience is significantly different. In AAA projects, the quality of content is usually high, with hundreds of thousands of hours invested in creating items, stories, and worlds. However, in the indie sector, the situation is different: there\u2019s a limited number of items, less variability \u2013 unless we talk about roguelikes, where world and item generation are used. A typical feature of roguelikes is the randomization of item attributes. However, they rarely offer unique generation of names or descriptions; if they do, it\u2019s more about applying formulas and substitution rules, rather than AI. This opens new possibilities for the use of artificial intelligence \u2013 not just as a means of generating random attributes, but also in creating deep, unique stories, characters, and worlds, adding a new dimension to games. Integrating AI for Item Generation: How AI Can Assist in Creating Unique Items (Clothing, Weapons, Consumables). One of the practical examples of using AI is creating variations based on existing criteria. Why do I consider this the best way to utilize AI? Firstly, having written the story of your game world, we can set limits for the AI, providing clear input and output data. This ensures a 100% predictable outcome from AI. Let\u2019s examine this more closely. When talking about the world\u2019s story, I mean a few pages that describe the world, its nature, and rules. It could be fantasy, sci-fi, with examples of names, unique terminology, or characteristic features that help AI understand the mood and specifics of the world. Here is an excerpt from the text I wrote for my game world. The Kingdom of Arteria is an ancient and mysterious realm, shrouded in secrets and imbued with a powerful form of dark magic. For centuries, it has been ruled by Arteon the First, a wise and just monarch whose benevolence has brought peace and prosperity to his\u2026](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/how-to-use-artificial-intelligence-in-creating-content-for-rpg-games/)\n\n#### Let's discuss your ideas\n\n[Contact us](https://www.qualium-systems.com/contact/)\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\n[AddToAny](https://www.addtoany.com/ \"Share Buttons\")\n\n[More\u2026](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/meta-connect-2024-major-innovations-in-ar-vr-and-ai/#addtoany \"Show all\")\n\nA2A\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)",

Additionally, Scout Advisor links every player to Sevilla FC\u2019s own data applications to obtain deep insights about their quantitative performance figures.\n\nMeanwhile, [AddAI](https://addai.life/en/about/) is a Czech Republic-based customer interaction platform that enables companies to deploy and operate omnichannel AI assistants. With Llama as the foundation model and using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methodology, IBM engineers supported a pilot to create an AI-driven Q&A chatbot to ensure precise responses in the Czech language, with a 50% reduction in unanswered client queries.\n\nBusinesses and governments face similar struggles to handle increasing paperwork efficiently while accelerating their work. One IBM business partner created a new AI data discovery solution built on watsonx.ai using Llama to expedite large document processing. The solution helps officials find information, generate documents, and spend less time in the office and more in the field.\n\nHere are just a few other examples of how developers are leveraging watsonx.ai and Meta\u2019s Llama models across a wide range of use cases:\n\n**Multinationals**\n\n- A major telecommunications company significantly improved its HR assistant solution using watsonx.ai and Llama. The update led to a 75% containment rate, reducing the need for human intervention. The tool also expanded from English-only to supporting Italian and German, expediting the rollout of assistants to new markets.\n- In a six-week generative AI pilot with IBM, a financial services company extracted key information and summaries from phone calls for bodily injury claims leveraging Llama2-13b-chat. The client created a tool to summarize victim calls that saved the handler an hour per case and allowed the victim to receive a copy of the report on the same day.\n\n**Governments**\n\n- In a pilot, a major European city\u2019s local government found it could match or exceed Watson Language Translator\u2019s capabilities in a Q&A assistant that translates and summarizes questions.\n- Through a six-week legal research automation pilot that involved four judges and dozens of active court cases, a European city\u2019s Ministry of Justice used generative AI to help simplify and speed up the judiciary\u2019s work, particularly in the context of mass lawsuits. Using a RAG approach, the project resulted in an estimated 50% reduction in case preparation time.\n\n**Software as a service (SaaS)**\n\n- A major enterprise SaaS vendor for contract lifecycle management is partnering with IBM to embed watsonx.ai as the unified backbone for its platform. This solution, with Llama as the foundation model, will make generative AI contract processes available to everyone in the organization, allowing them to extract actionable insights from contract data.\n\n**Talent acquisition**\n\n- In a proof of concept, a major talent acquisition firm found that it could lower costs by 90% by switching its HR automation to watsonx.ai on IBM Cloud.\n\n**Finance**\n\n- Financial analysts and asset owners struggle to understand an event\u2019s impact on an asset\u2019s value. With watsonx.ai\u2019s generative AI, an enterprise digital asset service provider can give asset owners a real-time valuation of their portfolio. Summarization of relevant events has enabled analysts to value a portfolio in five minutes instead of hours each day.\n- In a four-week pilot, a major cloud banking and financial services platform worked with IBM Client Engineering to evaluate the impact watsonx.ai could have on its tools for monitoring bank transactions for suspicious activity\u2014estimating more than 80% improvements in transaction insight generation.\n\n**Information management**\n\n- In a collaboration with IBM Client Engineering on an archive digitization and data cataloging use case that leveraged Llama, a major information management solutions provider used watsonx.ai to automatically classify documents and extract details while migrating projects to save time and gain new insights.\n\n**Media**\n\n- A Middle Eastern press agency is using watsonx.ai and Llama to save editors time and enhance their work. The organization has reduced redundant article reviews, automated translations, adapted articles for social media distribution and generated more compelling titles for stories. Editors saved up to 95% of their time previously spent on manual searches and reviews.\n\n**Tech and IT**\n\n- A major global technology and investment group worked with IBM to create a speech- and text-based Q&A chatbot using watsonx.ai and a RAG approach. This level of human-like Q&A will lead to more customer engagement and enable human customer service agents to optimize their time.\n- To offload service desk agents from trivial tasks, a major European IT services provider and IBM developed a digital assistant solution that could search through its enterprise data to solve customer problems. The assistant reduced the duration of a support ticket from around three hours to mere minutes. An evaluation of the answers indicated 93% accuracy before any prompt tuning.\n\n[Share your Llama story](https://www.llama.com/community-stories/#sharellamastory)\n\nOur latest updates delivered to

Today, we\u2019re excited to release some of the latest research, code, models, and datasets from Meta Fundamental AI Research (FAIR). The artifacts we\u2019re sharing today focus on building more capable agents, robustness and safety, and architecture innovations that enable models to learn new information more effectively and scale beyond current limits.\n\nIn this release, we\u2019re sharing a demo and code for Meta Video Seal, an open source model work video watermarking that builds on the popular [Meta Audio Seal](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audioseal) work we shared last year. We\u2019re also sharing a variety of other artifacts, including a foundation model for controlling the behavior of virtual embodied agents, a method for scaling memory layers that will enable more factual information, and code to help models become more socially intelligent. There\u2019s plenty more to explore in this post with nine total projectsand artifacts ready for people to download and start using today.\n\nThis work supports our long and proven track record of sharing open reproducible science with the community. By publicly sharing our early research work, we hope to inspire iterations and ultimately help advance AI in a responsible way. As always, we look forward to seeing what the community will build using these new releases and continuing the dialogue about how we can all advance AI together responsibly and build for the greater good.\n\nMeta Motivo\n\nUnsupervised reinforcement learning involves pre-training models to solve a wide range of downstream tasks in complex environments. Most methods require highly curated interaction datasets and often rely on unsupervised losses that lead to policies that may not align well with target tasks. Today, we\u2019re sharing Meta Motivo, a first-of-its-kind behavioral foundation model that controls the movements of a virtual embodied humanoid agent to perform complex tasks.\n\nMeta Motivo is trained with a novel algorithm that leverages an unlabeled dataset of motions to ground unsupervised reinforcement learning towards learning human-like behaviors while retaining zero-shot inference capabilities. The key technical novelty of our algorithm is to learn a representation that can be used to embed states, motions, and rewards into the same latent space. As a result, Meta Motivo is able to solve a wide range of whole-body control tasks, including motion tracking, goal pose reaching, and reward optimization, without any additional training or planning.\n\nMeta Motivo achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised reinforcement learning and model-based baselines, while exhibiting more human-like behaviors. The model also displays a surprising level of robustness to changes in the environment, such as gravity, wind, or direct perturbations, despite not being trained for them.\n\nIn the future, we believe this research could pave the way for fully embodied agents in the Metaverse, leading to more lifelike NPCs, democratization of character animation, and new types of immersive experiences.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/zero-shot-whole-body-humanoid-control-via-behavioral-foundation-models/)\n\n[Try the demo](https://metamotivo.metademolab.com/)\n\n[Download the code and model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/metamotivo)\n\nMeta Video Seal\n\nWhile AI tools can help bring the world closer together, it\u2019s important that we implement safeguards to mitigate the risks of imitation, manipulation, and other forms of misuse that can undermine their benefits. Post-hoc watermarking is a crucial step towards better traceability for content and AI models.\n\nToday, we\u2019re releasing Meta Video Seal, a state-of-the art comprehensive framework for neural video watermarking. Video Seal adds a watermark (with an optional hidden message) into videos that is imperceptible to the naked eye and can later be uncovered to determine a video\u2019s origin. The watermark has proven resilience against common video editing efforts like blurring or cropping, as well as compression algorithms commonly used when sharing content online. We\u2019re publicly releasing the Video Seal model under a permissive license, along with a research paper, training code, and inference code. A demo is also available to try the model out interactively.\n\nAlong with Video Seal, we\u2019re also releasing Meta Omni Seal Bench, a leaderboard dedicated to neural watermarking covering several modalities, enabling the research community to easily test and add their own work in the field. We\u2019re also re-releasing our Meta Watermark Anything model under a permissive license and will organize [a workshop on watermarking at ICLR in 2025.](https://sites.google.com/view/genai-watermark)\n\nThis research is a testimony to our commitment to responsible AI. We hope that other researchers and developers will join our efforts by integrating watermarking capabilities when building generative AI models. Watermark Anything, Video Seal, and Audio Seal\u2014our previous work on post-hoc audio watermarking\u2014are now all available for download and ready to be integrated.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/video-seal-open-and-efficient-video-watermarking/)\n\n[Try the demo](https://aidemos.meta.com/videoseal)\n\n[Download the Video Seal code and model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/videoseal)\n\n[Download the Watermark Anything code and model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/watermark-anything)\n\n[View the Omni Seal Bench leaderboard](https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnisealbench)\n\nFlow Matching guide and codebase, a Meta FAIR release\n\nFlow Matching is a state-of-the-art generative paradigm for many modalities including generation of images, videos, audio, music, 3D structures like proteins, and more. Our method has already replaced classical diffusion in many generative applications at Meta, including Meta [Movie Gen](https://ai.meta.com/blog/movie-gen-media-foundation-models-generative-ai-video/), Meta [Audiobox](https://ai.meta.com/blog/audiobox-generating-audio-voice-natural-language-prompts/), and Meta [Melody Flow](https://voicebox.metademolab.com/), and across the industry in works such as Stable-Diffusion-3, Flux, Fold-Flow, and Physical Intelligence Pi\\_0. Flow Matching provides a simple yet flexible generative AI framework, improving performance and efficiency while allowing easy generalization to complex data. Today, we\u2019re sharing a paper and code, including core implementations of both continuous and discrete Flow Matching, alongside state-of-the-art training scripts to enable the research community to easily use and iterate on the Flow Matching method. By publicly sharing this work, we hope to inspire wider adoption of Flow Matching and enable people to use it in their own generative projects.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/flow-matching-guide-and-code/)\n\n[Download the code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flow_matching)\n\nMeta Explore Theory-of-Mind\n\nA key aspect of our social intelligence enables us to reason about the thoughts and beliefs of other agents, both human and artificial. Existing Theory-of-Mind (ToM) datasets have limitations, focusing solely on evaluation and depicting only a narrow range of interactions. To address this and move closer to achieving advanced machine intelligence, we introduce Meta Explore Theory-of-Mind, a program-guided adversarial data generation for theory of mind reasoning. Our novel framework enables the generation of diverse, challenging, and scalable ToM reasoning data for both training and evaluation, which will help accelerate progress in this critical area of research.\n\n![](https://scontent-fml1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/470090194_885853727093453_4651375064551711472_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=_0CUkd3AUssQ7kNvgFhOjvd&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-fml1-1.xx&_nc_gid=AzOGd21NGEYDjiGY3SrN9VU&oh=00_AYA0zbILYNCwI_rQlf5cZcUA6kUbYnBoa4urKH-IXLjMsA&oe=67857DB4)\n\nExplore Theory-of-Mind generates robust and reliable stories that push the limits of large language models (LLMs), making it ideal for evaluating frontier models or fine-tuning data, resulting in significant improvements on classic theory of mind benchmarks. Our first-of-its-kind approach led to a 27-point accuracy improvement on the commonly used ToMi benchmark when fine-tuning a Llama-3.1 7B model, which means unprecedented accuracy in evaluating the theory of mind training data. Explore Theory-of-Mind can be used to generate datasets for improving LLMs, enhance goal-oriented scenarios, and collect interaction datasets, while also serving as a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/explore-theory-of-mind-program-guided-adversarial-data-generation-for-theory-of-mind-reasoning/)\n\n[Download the code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ExploreToM)\n\n[Download the dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/ExploreToM)\n\nMeta Large Concept Models\n\nAs we work toward advanced machine intelligence, models will need to be able to reason across languages and modalities and to excel at long-form generational capabilities that require explicit hierarchical thinking, such as writing an essay. Current mainstream language modeling approaches typically operate at the token level and don\u2019t explicitly reason in a hierarchical manner.\n\nToday, we\u2019re introducing a fundamentally different training paradigm for language modeling: the Large Concept Model (LCM). The core idea of the LCM is to decouple reasoning from language representation, and it\u2019s inspired by how humans can plan high-level thoughts to communicate. For example, when giving a presentation multiple times, a presenter always has the same series of ideas they want to convey (materialized by their slides projected on screen), but their exact choice of words might vary from one run to the other.\n\n![](https://scontent-fml20-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/469933570_3803908129873587_2022361715417707411_n.png?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=-E6d0Qm4LU0Q7kNvgHRDt58&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-fml20-1.xx&_nc_gid=AzOGd21NGEYDjiGY3SrN9VU&oh=00_AYAOYF_dMt4D1BvUjP13Y6YnkqvMhfFkIfj9iEHz_tnvfQ&oe=67855737)\n\nGuided by that principle, the LCM is a significant departure from a typical LLM. Rather than predicting the next token, the LCM is trained to predict the next concept or high-level idea, represented by a full sentence in a multimodal and multilingual embedding space. Our work explores how predictions can be made for text in such a continuous space. Overall, the LCM outperforms or matches recent LLMs in the pure generative task of summarization, offers strong zero-shot generalization to unseen languages, and is more computationally efficient as input context grows. We hope the research community uses this work to improve language models that can operate on any modality or language, in an explicit hierarchical manner.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/large-concept-models-language-modeling-in-a-sentence-representation-space/)\n\n[Download the code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/large_concept_model)\n\nMeta Dynamic Byte Latent Transformer\n\nLanguage models assume text has been tokenized in a heuristic preprocessing step, breaking words into smaller units that are easier to process. This limits end-to-end learning, is difficult to optimize in practice, and can hurt performance on rare text sequences. To address this, we\u2019re introducing Dynamic Byte Latent Transformer, a hierarchical byte-level (tokenizer-free) model with dynamic patching schemes that are able to operate over bytes\u2014without any tokenization heuristics\u2014while also improving efficiency for long sequences during training and inference.\n\nDynamic Byte Latent Transformer outperforms tokenizer-based models across the board in terms of robustness, with a seven point advantage on average, and excels at processing longtail and rare sequences of unseen symbols. By sharing this work, we hope to accelerate advancements that will enable us to better reason over a variety of domains that are important to advanced machine intelligence, including low resource languages, coding, and factuality.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transformer-patches-scale-better-than-tokens/)\n\n[Download the code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/blt)\n\nMeta Memory Layers\n\nParametric memory, the repository of factual information stored in the weights on a neural network during pretraining, enables LLMs to understand complex concepts and linguistic nuances. As current scaling methods approach their limit of efficient scaling, new architectures that enable models to learn information more effectively must be explored. Today, we\u2019re sharing a research paper and code for Meta Memory Layers at Scale, a method for scaling memory layers that enables an increase in factuality against commonly used benchmarks as we work toward achieving advanced machine intelligence.\n\nMemory Layers use a trainable key-value lookup mechanism to add extra parameters to a model without increasing FLOPs. Sparsely activated memory layers complement the compute-heavy nature of dense feed-forward layers, providing dedicated capacity to store and retrieve information cheaply. On downstream tasks, language models augmented with our improved memory layer outperform dense models with more than twice the computation budget, as well as MoE models when matched for both compute and parameters.\n\nContrary to the prevailing perception in the field that sparse memory architectures cannot be scaled competitively, we demonstrate efficient scaling of sparse memory layers up to 128 billion parameters and 8B base models, with significant improvements at comparable compute across the board for commonly used factuality benchmarks.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/memory-layers-at-scale/)\n\n[Download the code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/memory)\n\nMeta Image Diversity Modeling\n\nThis year, FAIR has focused on research to better understand and develop new methods for the safe development of image generation models. Today, we\u2019re announcing updates on this research and releasing a comprehensive evaluation toolbox for text-to-image generative models. The image generation model we\u2019ve developed through the course of this research builds on our prior research on generative models\u2019 [architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03177) and [losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04873) and prioritizes generating images that are representative of the physical world while maintaining competitive image quality with state-of-the-art models.\n\nTo further the research into new methods and techniques for responsible development, we\u2019re collaborating with external experts, whom we\u2019re inviting to use our model to carry out research in areas that can help us to improve the safety and responsibility across image diversity modeling. This initiative highlights our commitment to collaborating with the wider AI research community to collectively advance AI responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, we will be open sourcing a comprehensive evaluation toolbox for text-to-image generative models to improve the ease and reproducibility of image generation benchmarking while promoting interpretable takeaways that inform future responsible text-to-image research.\n\nThrough our continued work, we hope to better understand and offer new methods for responsible development of image generative models that can be adopted by the broader research community.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/evalgim-a-library-for-evaluating-generative-image-models/)\n\n[Download the code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EvalGIM/tree/main)\n\nMeta CLIP 1.2\n\nWe\u2019re excited to release Meta CLIP 1.2, a milestone in our ongoing efforts to develop a high-performance vision-language encoder. We have been working on advanced algorithms to effectively curate and align vast amounts of image-text data, unlocking the learning of human knowledge about the world. This enables our models to learn efficiently and accurately, capturing the nuances of fine-grained mapping between image and language semantics.\n\nLarge-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets are essential for building foundation models that can learn about the world. Meta CLIP is our effort towards building such datasets and foundation models. To ensure a high-quality and safe vision-language encoder _foundation model_, we\u2019ve developed algorithms to effectively curate and align data with human knowledge from vast data pools, enabling our models to learn efficiently and cover all possibilities. We also conducted rigorous data research while applying robust integrity and privacy-protective measures.\n\nBy releasing our data algorithms, training recipes, and foundation models trained on our curated dataset, we\u2019re providing researchers and developers with the tools they need to advance the field of vision-language understanding. These foundation models can be used as vision encoding for MLLM, multi-modal embedding for retrieval, and zero-shot classification, while serving as a starting point for research on data quality. Additionally, our algorithms and training methods can also be used to create high-quality, large-scale, CLIP-like datasets from scratch, which can help with new research or production use cases.\n\n[Read the paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/meta-clip-12/)\n\n[Download the dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/activebus/Altogether-FT)\n\n[Download the

        "markdown": "\n\nMeta is releasing a massive data set and models, called Open Materials 2024, that could help scientists use AI to discover new materials much faster. OMat24, as it's been dubbed, tackles one of the biggest bottlenecks in the discovery process: data.\n\nTo find new materials, scientists calculate the properties of elements across the periodic table and simulate different combinations on computers. This work could help us discover new materials with properties that can help mitigate climate change, for example, by making better batteries or helping create new sustainable fuels.\n\nBut it requires massive data sets that are hard to come by. Creating them requires a lot of computing power and is very expensive. Many of the top data sets and models available now are also proprietary, and researchers don\u2019t have access to them. That\u2019s where Meta is hoping to help: The company is releasing its new data set and models today for free and is making them open source. The [data set](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fairchem/OMAT24) and [models](https://huggingface.co/fairchem/OMAT24) are available on Hugging Face for anyone to download, tinker with, and use.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really firm believers that by contributing to the community and building upon open-source data models, the whole community moves further, faster,\u201d says Larry Zitnick, the lead researcher for the OMat project.\n\n[iframe](https://buy.tinypass.com/checkout/template/cacheableShow?aid=WUOCNSUgpu&templateId=OTCBIZBLG8WE&templateVariantId=OTVOI7W3OB1SJ&offerId=fakeOfferId&experienceId=EX43E7JR539R&iframeId=offer_24bfb7c14f88f376d107-0&displayMode=inline&pianoIdUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.technologyreview.com%2Fid%2F&widget=template&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com)\n\nZitnick says the new OMat24 model will top the [Matbench Discovery leaderboard](https://matbench-discovery.materialsproject.org/), which ranks the best machine-learning models for materials science. Its data set will also be one of the biggest available.\n\n\u201cMaterials science is having a machine-learning revolution,\u201d says Shyue Ping Ong, a professor of nanoengineering at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the project.\n\nPreviously, scientists were limited to doing very accurate calculations of material properties on very small systems or doing less accurate calculations on very big systems, says Ong. The processes were laborious and expensive. Machine learning has bridged that gap, and AI models allow scientists to perform simulations on combinations of any elements in the periodic table much more quickly and cheaply, he says.\n\nMeta\u2019s decision to make its data set openly available is more significant than the AI model itself, says G\u00e1bor Cs\u00e1nyi, a professor of molecular modeling at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work.\n\n\u201cThis is in stark contrast to other large industry players such as Google and Microsoft, which also recently published competitive-looking models which were trained on equally large but secret data sets,\u201d Cs\u00e1nyi says.\n\nTo create the OMat24 data set, Meta took an existing one called [Alexandria](https://alexandria.icams.rub.de/) and sampled materials from it. Then they ran various simulations and calculations of different atoms to scale it.\n\nMeta\u2019s data set has around 110 million data points, which is many times larger than earlier ones. Others also don\u2019t necessarily have high-quality data, says Ong.\n\nMeta has significantly expanded the data set beyond what the current materials science community has done, and with high accuracy, says Ong.\n\nCreating the data sets requires vast computational capacity, and Meta is one of the few companies in the world that can afford that. Zitnick says the company has another motive for this work: It\u2019s hoping to find new materials to make its [smart augmented-reality glasses](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/01/1104581/the-coolest-thing-about-smart-glasses-is-not-the-ar-its-the-ai/) more affordable.\n\nPrevious work on open databases, such as one created by the [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/), has transformed computational materials science over the last decade, says Chris Bartel, an assistant professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the University of Minnesota, who was also not involved in Meta\u2019s work.\n\n[iframe](https://buy.tinypass.com/checkout/template/cacheableShow?aid=WUOCNSUgpu&templateId=OT1UKGGYDABG&templateVariantId=OTVTLEV0GZQ3H&offerId=fakeOfferId&experienceId=EXGEI687Y0O9&iframeId=offer_6d272664aea326c7181e-0&displayMode=inline&pianoIdUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.technologyreview.com%2Fid%2F&widget=template&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com)\n\nTools such as Google\u2019s [GNoME (graphical networks for material exploration)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/29/1084061/deepmind-ai-tool-for-new-materials-discovery/) have shown that the potential to find new materials increases with the size of the training set, he adds.\n\n\u201cThe public release of the \\[OMat24\\] data set is truly a gift for the community and is certain to immediately accelerate research in this space,\u201d Bartel says.\n\nhide\n\n### Deep Dive\n\n### Artificial intelligence\n\n[![&quot;&quot;](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/replicant3.jpg)\\\\\n**AI can now create a replica of your personality**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/20/1107100/ai-can-now-create-a-replica-of-your-personality/)\n\nA two-hour interview is enough to accurately capture your values and preferences, according to new research from Stanford and Google DeepMind.\n\nBy\n\n- [James O'Donnellarchive page](https://www.technologyreview.com/author/james-odonnell/)\n\n[![Photo illustration showcasing a thumbs-down AI generated hand with 6 fingers](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/241220_aifailv2.jpg)\\\\\n**The biggest AI flops of 2024**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/31/1109612/biggest-worst-ai-artificial-intelligence-flops-fails-2024/)\n\nFrom chatbots dishing out illegal advice to dodgy AI-generated search results, take a look back over the year\u2019s top AI failures.\n\nBy\n\n- [Rhiannon Williamsarchive page](https://www.technologyreview.com/author/rhiannon-williams/)\n\n[![Ai-generated Minecraft simulation showing map of civilizations](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/civ-thumb.gif)\\\\\n**These AI Minecraft characters did weirdly human stuff all on their own**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/27/1107377/a-minecraft-town-of-ai-characters-made-friends-invented-jobs-and-spread-religion/)\n\nHundreds of LLM-powered AI agents spontaneously made friends, invented jobs, and spread religion.\n\nBy\n\n- [Niall Firtharchive page](https://www.technologyreview.com/author/niall-firth/)\n\n[![screenshot from Project Astra demo](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-190642.png)\\\\\n**Google\u2019s new Project Astra could be generative AI\u2019s killer app**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/11/1108493/googles-new-project-astra-could-be-generative-ais-killer-app/)\n\nGoogle just launched a ton of new products\u2014including Gemini 2.0, which could power a new world of agents.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% year-over-year.\n- **Costs and expenses** \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $24.22 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year.\n- **Capital expenditures**\u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $8.47 billion.\n- **Capital return program**\u2013 Share repurchases were $6.32 billion of our Class A common stock and dividend payments were $1.27 billion.\n- **Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities** \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $58.08 billion as of June 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $10.90 billion.\n- **Headcount**\u2013 Headcount was 70,799 as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of 1% year-over-year.\n\n**CFO Outlook Commentary**\n\nWe expect third quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5-41 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nWhile we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.\n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35-40 billion. While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on\u00a0April\u00a025, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at [investor.fb.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4221574-1&h=1224552136&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.fb.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&a=investor.fb.com) and on the SEC website at [www.sec.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4221574-1&h=521958770&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&a=www.sec.gov). Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is July\u00a031, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\n_Foreign exchange effect on revenue_. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\n_Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases._\u00a0We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **META PLATFORMS, INC.** |\n| **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME** |\n| _(In millions, except per share amounts)_ |\n| _(Unaudited)_ |\n|  | **Three Months Ended June 30,** |  | **Six Months Ended June 30,** |\n|  | **2024** |  | **2023** |  | **2024** |  | **2023** |\n| **Revenue** | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 39,071 |  | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 31,999 |  | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 75,527 |  | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 60,645 |\n| **Costs and expenses:** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Cost of revenue | 7,308 |  | 5,945 |  | 13,948 |  | 12,054 |\n| Research and development | 10,537 |  | 9,344 |  | 20,515 |  | 18,725 |\n| Marketing and sales | 2,721 |  | 3,154 |  | 5,285 |  | 6,198 |\n| General and administrative (1) | 3,658 |  | 4,164 |  | 7,114 |  | 7,049 |\n| **Total costs and expenses** | 24,224 |  | 22,607 |  | 46,862 |  | 44,026 |\n| **Income from operations** | 14,847 |  | 9,392 |  | 28,665 |  | 16,619 |\n| Interest and other income (expense), net | 259 |  | (99) |  | 624 |  | (19) |\n| Income before provision for income taxes | 15,106 |  | 9,293 |  | 29,289 |  | 16,600 |\n| Provision for income taxes | 1,641 |  | 1,505 |  | 3,455 |  | 3,102 |\n| **Net income** | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13,465 |  | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7,788 |  | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 25,834 |  | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13,498 |\n| **Earnings per share:** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Basic | $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05.31 |  | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.03 |  | $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010.17 |  | $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05.24 |\n| Diluted | $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05.16 |  | $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.98 |  | $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a09.86 |  | $\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05.18 |\n| **Weighted-average shares used to compute earnings per share:** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Basic | 2,534 |  | 2,568 |  | 2,540 |  | 2,577 |\n| Diluted | 2,610 |  | 2,612 |  | 2,619 |  | 2,604 |\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| (1) The second quarter 2024 general and administrative expenses include a charge for the recent settlement with the State of Texas.

That represents Meta\u2019s lowest year-over-year growth for net income since the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company reported 3.29 billion daily active people for the third quarter. That was up 5% year over year but came in below analysts\u2019 expectations of 3.31 billion.\n\nMeta also raised capital expenditures guidance for the 2024 fiscal year to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion previously. Additionally, the company said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 due to an acceleration in infrastructure expenses.\n\n\u201cOur AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there, too,\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday on a call with analysts.\n\nZuckerberg has been pointing to the company\u2019s massive investments in\u00a0[artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html), which includes\u00a0[spending billions of dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/18/mark-zuckerberg-indicates-meta-is-spending-billions-on-nvidia-ai-chips.html)\u00a0on\u00a0[Nvidia\u2019s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)\u00a0popular graphics processing units, as helping improve the company\u2019s core online ad business in the aftermath of\u00a0[Apple\u2019s 2021 iOS privacy update](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html). The company has been improving upon and building more data centers to help provide the technology infrastructure needed for its AI strategy.\n\nMore than one million advertisers have used Meta\u2019s generative AI advertising tools, Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta said it expects total expenses for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of between $96 billion and $98 billion, which is lower than previous guidance of $96 billion to $99 billion.\n\nMeta\u2019s advertising revenue came in at $39.9 billion for the quarter, up 18.7% year over year. Advertising accounted for 98.3% of Meta\u2019s total revenue in the third quarter.\n\nRevenue from Meta\u2019s Asia-Pacific region grew 15%, representing the company\u2019s slowest-growing region, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on the call. That was down from growth of 28% in the second quarter, and Li attributed the deceleration to lapping demand from China advertisers. Investors were concerned that slower digital ad spending\u00a0[by China-linked online retailers such as Temu and Shein](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/metas-continued-rally-could-hinge-on-fortunes-of-temu-and-shein.html) would affect Meta\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nMeta said it is expecting fourth-quarter revenue to be between $45 billion and $48 billion. The midpoint of that guidance is higher than the analyst consensus of $46.3 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s Reality Labs hardware unit [posted](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/metas-reality-labs-posts-4point4-billion-loss-in-third-quarter.html) an operating loss of $4.4 billion in the third quarter, which was less than analysts\u2019 expectations of $4.68 billion. Sales in that unit jumped 29% year over year to $270 million in the third quarter, trailing analysts\u2019 expectations of $310.4 million.\n\nSince 2020, Meta\u2019s [Reality Labs](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/metas-reality-labs-posts-4point5-billion-loss-in-second-quarter.html) unit has recorded an operating loss of more than\u00a0$58 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s overall headcount grew 9% year over year to 72,404 as of Sept. 30.\n\nThe social media company\u2019s results come a day after digital ad companies [Alphabet](/quotes/GOOG/), [Reddit](/quotes/RDDT/) and [Snap](/quotes/SNAP/) all reported solid quarterly earnings. [Microsoft](/quotes/MSFT/) reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines.\n\nAlphabet on Tuesday said [third-quarter sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/alphabet-to-report-q3-earnings-after-the-bell.html) from its Google Cloud unit came in at $11.35 billion, up 35% compared to a year prior. The company\u00a0attributed its strong cloud results to its AI offerings, which include subscriptions for enterprise customers.\n\nMicrosoft on Wednesday [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/microsoft-msft-q1-earnings-report-2025.html) that revenue from its Azure cloud unit was up 33% year over year, with 12 points coming from AI services.\n\n[Apple](/quotes/AAPL/) and [Amazon](/quotes/AMZN/) report quarterly financials on Thursday.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\n\n- [Wall Street analysts see big gains for these Warren Buffett-owned stocks in 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/05/wall-street-analysts-see-big-gains-for-these-buffett-owned-stocks-in-2025.html)\n- [Dan Niles names cash as a top pick for the first time since market drop in 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/06/dan-niles-names-cash-as-a-top-pick-for-the-first-time-since-market-drop-in-2022.html)\n- [Morgan Stanley says rising rates are threatening the bull market so ride it out in these quality stocks](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/06/morgan-stanley-says-high-rates-threaten-bull-market-ride-it-out-in-these-stocks.html)\n- [Goldman adds three stocks to conviction list to start year, including one where it sees nearly 60% upside](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/02/goldmans-three-new-conviction-stocks-include-one-with-60percent-upside.html)\n\n\n**WATCH**: [Meta\u2019s revenue has room to run despite all their AI spending](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/10/22/metas-revenue-has-room-to-run-despite-all-their-ai-spending-says-jefferies-brent-thill.html).\n\n![Meta's revenue has room to run despite all their AI spending, says Jefferies' Brent Thill](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108051162-17296196331729619629-36784926018-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1729619631&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO6:1406:14\n\nMeta\u2019s revenue has room to run despite all their AI spending, says Jefferies\u2019 Brent Thill\n\n[The Exchange](https://www.cnbc.com/the-exchange/)\n\n[iframe](https://sp.auth.adobe.com/entitlement/v4/AccessEnablerProxy.html?a4f31600ce9c60894320#https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F10%2F30%2Fmeta-q3-earnings-report-2024.html)\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfnMFMeAAAAABvWy2u0ZzAqPaVUflZOPibgK-u5&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=zIriijn3uj5Vpknvt_LnfNbF&size=invisible&cb=9s9z9gue9ey7)",

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\n- **Costs and expenses** \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\n- **Capital expenditures**\u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\n- **Capital return program**\u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\n- **Cash, cash** **equivalents, and marketable securities** \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\n- **Long-term debt** \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\n- **Headcount**\u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\n**CFO Outlook Commentary**\n\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at [investor.fb.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4288699-1&h=516644425&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.fb.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&a=investor.fb.com) and on the SEC website at [www.sec.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4288699-1&h=1227490803&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&a=www.sec.gov). Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\n_Foreign exchange effect on revenue_. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\n_Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases._ We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Unlike providers of cloud services, however, it does not expect to earn money from those investments right away and therefore is more subject to scrutiny from investors around its spending.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nA line chart that compares the growth of the Magnificent Seven's combined stock price to the rest of the S&P 500 over the past year\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged in a conference call with analysts that more infrastructure spending \"is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term,\" but said the company nonetheless would continue to invest.\n\n\"I just think that the opportunities here are really big,\" he said.\n\nZuckerberg added that Meta AI, a generative AI chatbot assistant that can generate images and answer questions, now has more than 500 million monthly active users.

Its shares [sank in April](/technology/meta-raises-2024-expenses-forecast-support-ai-development-2024-04-24/) after it disclosed a higher-than-expected expense forecast, knocking $200 billion off its stock-market value.\n\nThat ended a [run of strong quarters](/technology/facebook-parent-meta-declares-first-ever-dividend-2024-02-01/) for Meta, which has climbed back from a share-price meltdown in 2022 by slimming its workforce, leaning in to investor excitement about AI and earlier this year issuing its first-ever dividend.\n\nThe company's shares are up around 500% from the bottom and about 67% so far this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, analysts also questioned Meta about its headcount, which stood at 72,404 employees, up from 66,185 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nChief Financial Officer Susan Li said Meta would focus on pushing parts of the company \"to be more efficient,\" including those continuing to add employees.\n\nMeta's earnings come after encouraging results from digital ad bellwethers Alphabet [(GOOGL.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GOOGL.O) and Snap [(SNAP.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/SNAP.N), [which both beat third-quarter revenue estimates](/technology/google-parent-alphabet-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-2024-10-29/) on Tuesday thanks in part to rising sales of AI-assisted ads.\n\nMeta reported third-quarter profit of $6.03 per share, compared with estimates of $5.25 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG. Third-quarter revenue stood at $40.59 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $40.29 billion.\n\nThe company also forecast between $45 billion and $48 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, compared with analysts' estimates of $46.31 billion, according to data from LSEG.\n\nAdvertising accounts for the vast majority of Meta's revenue, meaning higher marketing spend by retailers and other businesses during the holiday season could provide a crucial boost to the company's bottom line, analysts say.\n\nMeta's family daily active people (DAP), a metric it uses to track unique users who open any one of its apps in a day, grew 5% in the third quarter to 3.29 billion. DAP increased 7% in the preceding June quarter, to 3.27 billion.\n\nThe company is well-positioned to squeeze more revenue out of users even as user growth slows, given that its AI tools can show people more content that match their interests, Enberg said.\n\nThe company's Reality Labs division, which produces its Quest virtual reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's [(ESLX.PA), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ESLX.PA) Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses, lost $4.4 billion in the third quarter, narrower than analyst estimates of a $4.7 billion loss.\n\nIn thinking about Reality Labs investments for 2025, executives were excited about the progress and strong consumer interest they had seen around the smart glasses in particular, Li said.\n\nThe Technology Roundup newsletter brings the latest news and trends straight to your inbox.

        "markdown": "# Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call October $30^{\\\\mathtt{t h}}$ , 2024\n\nKenneth Dorell, Director, Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platforms third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Li, CFO.\n\nBefore we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward\u2010looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward\u2010looking statements.\n\nFactors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today\u2019s earnings press release, and in our quarterly report on form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward\u2010looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nDuring this call we will present both GAAP and certain non\u2010GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non\u2010GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.\n\nAnd now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\n# Mark Zuckerberg, CEO\n\nThanks, Ken. This was a good quarter with strong product and business momentum, and with parts of our long-term vision around AI and the future of computing coming into sharper focus. We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day -- and we're seeing rapid adoption of Meta AI and Llama, which is quickly becoming a standard across the industry.\n\nSo let's start with some highlights from the apps. For WhatsApp, the US remains one of our fastest growing countries. And we just passed a milestone of 2 billion calls made globally every day. On Facebook, we continue to see positive trends with young adults, especially in the US. On Instagram, global growth remains strong. We also launched Teen Accounts this quarter, which add built-in protections that limit who teens are messaging and what content they can see. On Threads, the community now has almost 275 million monthly actives. It has been growing more than 1 million sign-ups per day. Engagement is growing too. So we continue to be on track towards this becoming our next major social app.\n\nWe are making a lot of progress with our AI efforts too, and we're seeing AI have a positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work -- from our core business engagement and monetization to our long-term roadmaps for new services and computing platforms. And I think that this partially comes from having a vision and roadmap that is aligned with the direction that technology is heading, but even more importantly from our teams doing some really excellent work on execution on so many fronts.\n\nMeta AI now has more than 500 monthly actives. Improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an $8%$ increase in time spent on Facebook and a $6%$ increase on Instagram this year alone. More than a million advertisers used our GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in the last month, and we estimate that businesses using Image Generation are seeing a $7%$ increase in conversions -- and we believe that there is a lot more upside here.\n\nWe're also seeing great momentum with Llama. Llama token usage has grown exponentially this year, and the more widely that Llama gets adopted and becomes the industry standard, the more that the improvements to its quality and efficiency will flow back to all of our products. This quarter, we released Llama 3.2, including the leading small models that run on-device and open source multi-modal models. We're working with enterprises to make it easier to use, and now we're also working with the public sector to adopt Llama across the US government.\n\nThe Llama 3 models have been something of an inflection point in the industry, but I'm even more excited about Llama 4, which is now well into its development. We're training the Llama 4 models on a cluster that is bigger than 100k H100s or bigger than anything that I've seen reported for what others are doing. I expect that the smaller Llama 4 models will be ready first, and they\u2019ll be ready, we expect sometime early next year, and I think that they're going to be a big deal on several fronts -- new modalities, capabilities, stronger reasoning, and much faster. It seems pretty clear to me that open source will be the most cost-effective, customizable, trustworthy, performant, and easiest-to-use option that is available to developers, and I'm proud that Llama is leading the way on this.\n\nNow it's the time of the year at Meta when we plan our budget for the next year. That's still in progress, but I wanted to share a few things that have stood out to me as we've gone through this process so far. First, it's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there. Second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too. We haven't decided on a final budget yet, but those are some of the directional trends I'm seeing.\n\nMoving on, this quarter we also had several milestones around Reality Labs and the integration of AI and wearables.\n\nRay-Ban Meta glasses are the prime example here. They're great-looking glasses that let you take photos and videos, listen to music and take calls. But what makes them really special is the Meta AI integration. With our new updates it'll be able to not only answer your questions throughout the day, but also help you remember things, give you suggestions as you're doing things using realtime multimodal AI, and even translate other languages right in your ear for you. I continue to think that glasses are the ideal form factor for AI because you can let your AI see what you see, hear what you hear, and talk to you.\n\nDemand for the glasses continues to be very strong. The new clear edition that we released at Connect sold out almost immediately and has been trading online for over a thousand dollars. We've deepened our partnership with EssilorLuxottica to build future generations of smart eyewear that deliver both cutting-edge technology and style.\n\nAt Connect we also showed Orion, our first full holographic AR glasses. We've been working on this one for about a decade, and it gives you a sense of where this is all going. We're not too far off from being able to deliver great-looking glasses that let you seamlessly blend the physical and\n\ndigital worlds so you can feel present with anyone no matter where they are. We're starting to see the next computing platform come together, and it's pretty exciting.\n\nWe also released our newest mixed reality headset: Quest 3S. It brings the best capabilities of Quest 3 -- high quality color passthrough, a new chipset, and more -- at the much more accessible price point of $\\\\Phi300$ . Reviews are great so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing how well it does this holiday season as more people get their hands on it.\n\nOverall, this has been a good quarter. I'm pretty amped about all the work that we're doing right now. This may be the most dynamic moment that I've seen in our industry, and I'm focused on making sure that we build some awesome things and make the most of the opportunities ahead. And if we do this well, then the potential for Meta and everyone building with us will be massive. As always, I'm grateful for everyone who is on this journey with us -- our teams, our partners, and our investors.\n\nAnd now here's Susan.\n\n# Susan Li, CFO\n\nThanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.\n\nQ3 total revenue was $\\\\Phi40.6$ billion, up $19%$ or $20%$ on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were $\\\\Phi23.2$ billion, up $14%$ compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items:\n\nCost of revenue increased $19%$ , driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs. , mostly driven by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs. Marketing & Sales decreased $2%$ driven primarily by lower restructuring costs. G&A decreased $10%$ driven primarily by lower legal-related expenses. We ended the third quarter with over 72,400 employees, up $9%$ year-over-year, with growth primarily driven by hiring in our priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, generative AI, as well as regulation and compliance.\n\nThird quarter operating income was $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi}\\\\boldsymbol{17.4}$ billion, representing a $43%$ operating margin.\n\nOur tax rate for the quarter was $12%$ Net income was $\\\\Phi15.7$ billion or $\\\\Phi6.03$ per share.\n\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $\\\\Phi9.2$ billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Our capital expenditures were impacted in part by the timing of third quarter server deliveries, which will be paid for in the fourth quarter.\n\nFree cash flow was $\\\\Phi15.5$ billion. In Q3, we completed a debt offering of $\\\\Phi10.5$ billion, repurchased $\\\\Phi8.9$ billion of our Class A common stock and paid $\\\\Phi1.3$ billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $\\\\Phi70.9$ billion in cash and marketable securities and $\\\\Phi28.8$ billion in debt.\n\nMoving now to our segment results. I\u2019ll begin with our Family of Apps segment.\n\nOur community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in September.\n\nQ3 Total Family of Apps revenue was $\\\\Phi40.3$ billion, up $19%$ year over year. Q3 Family of Apps ad revenue was $\\\\Phi39.9$ billion, up $19%$ or $20%$ on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by healthcare and entertainment and media.\n\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at $23%$ and $27%$ , respectively. Asia-Pacific grew $18%$ and North America grew $16%$ . On an advertiser geography basis, total revenue growth was strongest in North America and Europe at $27%$ . Rest of World was up $17%$ , while Asia Pacific was the slowest growing region at $15%$ , decelerating from our second quarter growth rate of $28%$ due mainly to lapping a period of stronger demand from China-based advertisers.\n\nIn Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased $7%$ and the average price per ad increased $11%$ . Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand, in part due to improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces.\n\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $\\\\Phi434$ million, up $48%$ , driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform.\n\nWe continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $\\\\Phi18.5$ billion, representing approximately $80%$ of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up $13%$ , primarily due to higher infrastructure and headcount-related expenses, partially offset by lower legal-related expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $\\\\Phi21.8$ billion, representing a $54%$ operating margin.\n\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $\\\\Phi270$ million, up $29%$ driven by hardware sales. Reality Labs expenses were $\\\\Phi4.7$ billion, up $19%$ year-over-year driven primarily by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs.\n\nReality Labs operating loss was $\\\\Phi4.4$ billion.\n\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.\n\nOn the first, we are focused on both improving people\u2019s experiences within our apps today and investing in longer-term initiatives that have the potential to contribute to engagement in the years ahead.\n\nWe expect our content recommendations roadmap will span both of these timeframes, as we have nearer-term workstreams focused on improving recommendations as well as multi-year initiatives to develop innovative new approaches.\n\nI\u2019ll focus first on the near-term. In the third quarter, we continued to see daily usage grow yearover-year across Facebook and Instagram, both globally and in the U.S.\n\nOn Facebook, we\u2019re seeing strong results from the global rollout of our unified video player in June. Since introducing the new experience and prediction systems that power it, we\u2019ve seen a $10%$ increase in time spent within the Facebook video player. This month, we\u2019ve entered the next phase of Facebook\u2019s video product evolution. Starting in the US & Canada, we are updating the standalone video tab to a full screen viewing experience, which will allow people to seamlessly watch videos in a more immersive experience. We expect to complete this global roll out in early 2025.\n\nOn Instagram, Reels continues to see good traction and we\u2019re making ongoing progress with our focus on promoting original content, with more than $60%$ of recommendations now coming from original posts in the U.S. This is helping people find unique and differentiated content on Instagram while also helping earlier stage creators get discovered.\n\nNext, let me talk more about our multi-year roadmap for recommendations. Previously, we operated separate ranking and recommendation systems for each of our products because we found that performance did not scale if we expanded the model size and compute power beyond a certain point. However, inspired by the scaling laws we were observing with large language models, last year we developed new ranking model architectures capable of learning more effectively from significantly larger data sets. To start, we have been deploying these new architectures to our Facebook video ranking models, which has enabled us to deliver more relevant recommendations and unlock meaningful gains in watch time.\n\nNow, we\u2019re exploring whether these new models can unlock similar improvements to recommendations on other surfaces. After that, we will look to introduce cross-surface data to these models so our systems can learn from what is interesting to someone on one surface of our apps and use it to improve their recommendations on another. This will take time to execute, and there are other explorations that we will pursue in parallel. However, over time we are optimistic that this will unlock more relevant recommendations while also leading to higher engineering efficiency as we operate a smaller number of recommendation models.\n\nBeyond recommendations, we\u2019re making progress with our other longer-term engagement priorities, including Generative AI and Threads.\n\nMeta AI usage continues to scale as we make it available in more countries and languages. We\u2019re seeing lifts in usage as we improve our models and have introduced a number of enhancements in recent months to make Meta AI more helpful and engaging. Last month, we began introducing Voice, so you can speak with Meta AI more naturally, and it\u2019s now fully available in English to people in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In the US, people can now also upload photos to Meta AI to learn more about them, write captions for posts, and add, remove, or change things about their images with a simple text prompt. These are all built with our first multi-modal foundation model, Llama 3.2.\n\nThreads remains another area where we see exciting potential. We are bringing on an increasing number of new users each quarter while depth of engagement also continues to grow. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce more features to make it even easier for people to stay up to date on topics they care about.\n\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work.\n\nThe first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces, like video. Within Facebook, video engagement continues to shift to short form following the unification of our video player, and we expect this to continue with the transition of the video tab to a full screen format. This is resulting in organic video impressions growing more quickly than overall video time on Facebook, which provides more opportunities to serve ads.\n\nAcross both Facebook and Instagram, we are also continuing our broader work to optimize when and where we should show ads within a person\u2019s session. This is enabling us to drive revenue and conversion growth without increasing the number of ads.\n\nThe second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. Similar to organic content ranking, we are finding opportunities to achieve meaningful ads performance gains by adopting new approaches to modeling. For example, we recently deployed new learning and modeling techniques that enable our ads systems to consider the sequence of actions a person takes before and after seeing an ad. Previously, our ads systems could only aggregate those actions together, without mapping the sequence. This new approach allows our systems to better anticipate how audiences will respond to specific ads. Since we adopted the new models in the first half of this year we\u2019ve already seen a $^{2-4%}$ increase in conversions based on testing within selected segments.\n\nWe are also evolving our ads platform to ensure that the results we drive are customized to each business\u2019 objectives and to the way they measure value. In Q3, we introduced changes to our ads ranking and optimization models to take more of the cross-publisher journey into account, which we expect to increase the Meta-attributed conversions that advertisers see in their third party analytics tools. We\u2019re also testing new features and settings for advertisers that will allow them to optimize their campaigns for what they value most, such as driving incremental conversions rather than absolute conversions.\n\nFinally, there is continued momentum with our Advantage+ solutions, including our ad creative tools. We\u2019re seeing strong retention with advertisers using our generative AI-powered image expansion, background generation and text generation tools, and they\u2019re already driving improved performance for advertisers even at this early stage. Earlier this month we began testing our first video generation features - video expansion and image animation. We expect to make them more broadly available by early next year.\n\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to take a long-term view in running the business, which involves investing in a portfolio of opportunities that we expect will generate returns over different time periods. We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us, and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area. This includes investing in both near-term initiatives to deliver continued healthy revenue growth within our core business, as well as longer-term opportunities that have the scale to deliver compelling returns over time. Given the lead time of our longer-term investments, we also continue to maximize our flexibility so that we can react to market developments. Within Reality Labs, this has benefited us as we\u2019ve evolved our roadmaps to respond to the earlier-thanexpected success of smart glasses. Within generative AI, we expect significantly scaling up our infrastructure capacity now, while also prioritizing its fungibility, will similarly position us well to respond to how the technology and market develop in the years ahead.\n\nMoving now to our financial outlook.\n\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $\\\\Phi45{-}48$ billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $\\\\Phi96{-}98$ billion, updated from our prior range of $\\\\Phi96{-}99$ billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nTurning now to the capex outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $\\\\Phi38{-}40$ billion, updated from our prior range of $\\\\Phi37{-}40$ billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capex, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\n\nOn to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\nIn closing, this was another good quarter for our business. Our global community continues to grow, we're seeing ongoing momentum across our core priorities, and we have exciting opportunities ahead of us to drive further growth in our core business in 2025 and capitalize on the longer-term opportunities ahead.\n\nWith that, Krista, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.\n\n# Operator:\n\nThank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw your question, again press star one. Please limit yourself to one question. Please pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If you are streaming today\u2019s call, please mute your computer speakers. And your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n# Brian Nowak:\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Mark and one for Susan.\n\nMark, I wanted to sort of ask you about Meta AI a little bit.\n\nCan you help us understand some of the more recurring types of interactions or query types you\u2019re seeing with this product and whether they have commercial intent? And then just over time, how do you think about building your own inhouse search offering as opposed to partnering and having another player partner those queries?\n\nAnd then Susan, I wanted to ask you about sort of head count because you talked a lot about sort of infrastructure investment in \u201825. How do we sort of think about relative headcount investments into \u201825 to sort of support all that infrastructure versus what you\u2019ve been doing in 2024? Thanks.\n\n# Susan Li:\n\nBrian, thanks for the question. This is Susan. So your first question was around what kinds of recurring interactions that we see between people and to their usage of Meta AI. And we\u2019re seeing -- first of all, I think, as Mark mentioned, just we\u2019re excited about the progress of Meta AI.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously very early in its journey, but it continues to be on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by end of year and it has over 500 million monthly actives.\n\nAnd people are using it for many things. A number of the frequent use cases we\u2019re seeing include information gathering, help with how to tasks, which is the largest use case. But we also see people using it to go deeper on interests, to look for content on our services, for image generation, that\u2019s also been another pretty popular use case so far. And I would say, that in the near term our focus is really on making Meta AI increasingly valuable for people and if we\u2019re successful, we think there will be a broadening set of queries that people use it for, including more monetizable queries over time.\n\nThe second part of your question, Meta AI draws from content across the web to address timely questions from users, and it provides sources for those results from our search engine partners. We\u2019ve integrated with Bing and Google, both of whom offer great search experiences.\n\nLike other companies, we also train our Gen AI models on content that is publicly available online, and we crawl the web for a variety of purposes. Your second question was really, I think, around maybe how we\u2019re thinking about headcount in 2025. And we are still working through our budgeting processes for \u201825. That\u2019s in part why we changed our forward-looking guidance approach to give guidance in the next call.\n\nBut as we\u2019re working through this, we are looking at where there are opportunities for us to invest in our strategic priorities and that includes monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, Gen AI, our ongoing investments in regulation and compliance.\n\nAnd we\u2019re really evaluating each of those opportunities with an eye towards what either the measurable ROI looks like or what the strategic opportunity looks like, depending on what the area is. And we\u2019re supporting that by continuing to really focus on streamlining our operations elsewhere.\n\nSo we don\u2019t have -- we don\u2019t have specifics to share about headcount growth in 2025, but that gives you a little bit of the flavor of where we are in the budgeting process.\n\nOperator:\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\n# Eric Sheridan:\n\nThanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just one building on that question from Brian and going back to Mark\u2019s comments about the learnings as you do go through the business planning process. Mark, I wanted to understand better what you continue to learn about what the biggest opportunity sets are to apply AI to when you think about your platform, your product portfolio, and your internal processes because you sound quite optimistic about key learnings and how they continue to ramp and maybe even accelerate in terms of the potential for return profile? I just want to go a little bit deeper into what your key learnings are as you go through that process? Thank you.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: I think the main point here is just that it seems broadly applicable to a very wide variety of products. So there are areas that are more part of our core business from making Feed more relevant and Reels more relevant to making ads more relevant to helping advertisers generate better ads, to helping people create the content that they want, helping our integrity operations and compliance and the work that we do there, that\u2019s important.\n\nIt\u2019s very valuable across all these aspects of the core business, but then it also is going to enable completely new types of services, like we didn\u2019t have something like Meta AI before.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have something like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses before and AI is going to be a really important ingredient of all of these things. There are also other new products like that, things around AI Studio.\n\nThis year, we really focused on rolling out Meta AI as kind of our -- our kind of single assistant that people can ask any question to, but I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunities that I think we\u2019ll see ramp more over the next year in terms of both consumer and business use cases, for people interacting with a wide variety of different AI agents, consumer ones with AI Studio around whether it\u2019s different creators or kind of different agents that people create for entertainment.\n\nOr on the business side, we do want to continue making progress on this vision of making it so that any small business or any business over time can, with a few clicks, stand up an AI agent that can help do customer service and sell things to all of their customers around the world, and I think that\u2019s a huge opportunity.\n\nSo it\u2019s very broad. And I think part of what we\u2019re seeing is that there are a lot of opportunities. Some of the longer-term ones are on Meta AI or AI Studio; those aren\u2019t necessarily a next few years, massive profit opportunity. But there are a lot of things in the core business around engagement and monetization which I think will be, over the next few years.\n\nSo I think we\u2019re trying to make sure that we get the right people working on this and that we have the right amount of investment that\u2019s just going towards what we view as a very, very large opportunity.\n\nOperator:\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\nDouglas Anmuth: Great, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up first on Meta AI, Mark. I mean helpful context certainly to understand how people are using the platform today. Maybe you can just talk more about some of that functionality over time as agents are introduced, just how you really expect use cases to expand beyond just longer and more complex queries?\n\nAnd then, Susan, on CapEx, just trying to understand your comment on 4Q a little bit more. It sounds like some of the payments pushed into 4Q with the guidance suggesting $\\\\Phi15$ billion to $^{\\\\Phi77}$ billion in CapEx in the quarter? And is that something we should think about as run rate into 2025? Thank you.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I mean I can take the Meta AI question, although I\u2019m sort of intentionally now not saying too much about the new capabilities and modalities that we\u2019re launching with Llama 4 that are coming to Meta AI.\n\nI mean I noted in the comments upfront that there -- with each major generational update, I expect that there will be large new capacities that get added.\n\nBut I think that, that\u2019s just going to be -- that\u2019s partially what I\u2019m excited about, and we\u2019ll talk more about that next year when we\u2019re ready to. One of the trends that I do think we\u2019re going to see though is having the models not just power Meta AI or a single assistant, but across AI Studio and business agents, have that grow.\n\nI mean this year, if you look back to where we were about a year ago, we were starting to roll out Meta AI. This year we have really so far succeeded in having that grow and having a lot of people use that. There\u2019s obviously a lot more depth of engagement and new use cases that we want to add over time. But I\u2019d say that we\u2019re -- today, with AI Studio and business AIs about where we were with Meta AI about a year ago.\n\nSo I think in the next year, our goal around that is going to be to try to make those pretty widespread use cases, even though there\u2019s going to be a multiyear path to getting kind of the depth of usage and the business results around that that we want. So there\u2019s a lot to do here, though, and I\u2019m excited to talk about that starting earlier next year.\n\n# Susan Li:\n\nThanks, Doug. So your second question was about Q4 CapEx. The expected step-up in Q4 CapEx from Q3, part of that comes from increases in server spend and to a lesser extent, data center CapEx.\n\nBut with servers there are these timing dynamics at play that you referred to because we had these server deliveries that landed late in Q3. And so the cash doesn\u2019t go out the door basically until Q4, and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see the CapEx show up.\n\nAnd given the nature of capital expenditures, generally, there is some -- actually quite a bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. So it\u2019s a little bit hard to sort of extrapolate from any particular quarter. Overall, I\u2019d say we\u2019re growing our infrastructure investments significantly this year, and we expect significant growth again in 2025.\n\n# Operator:\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\n# Justin Post:\n\nGreat. I think I\u2019ll ask a cost question this time. Just thinking about use of AI and employee productivity, how are you able to utilize AI internally? And are you seeing big productivity gains in your R&D group? And second, I know I got to the headcount one more time but, Susan, how flexible is your headcount as you think about cost growth in other areas? Thanks.\n\n# Susan Li:\n\nJustin, so I\u2019ll take a crack at both of those. On the use of AI and employee productivity, it\u2019s certainly something that we -- that we\u2019re very excited about. I don\u2019t know that we have anything particularly quantitative that we\u2019re sharing right now.\n\nI think there are different efficiency opportunities with AI that we\u2019ve been focused on in terms of where we can reduce costs over time and generate savings through increasing internal productivity in areas like coding.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s early, but we\u2019re seeing a lot of adoption internally of our internal assistant and coding agent, and we continue to make Llama more effective at coding, which should also make this use case increasingly valuable to developers over time.\n\nThere are also places where we hope over time that we\u2019ll be able to deploy these tools against a lot of our content moderation efforts to help make the big body of content moderation work that we undertake, to help make it more efficient and effective for us to do so.\n\nAnd there are lots of other places around the company where I would say we\u2019re relatively early in exploring the way that we can use LLM based tools to make different types of work streams more efficient. So all that is to say, it\u2019s something we\u2019re pretty excited about.\n\nWe have lots of teams focused on it. There are sort of small opportunities and G&A functions to what we hope will be big opportunities in areas like content moderation and coding productivity over time.\n\nOn your second question about headcount, we\u2019re really -- again, we\u2019re still midbudget. So there\u2019s -- we don\u2019t have very much that is definitive to share about this at the time. But as we\u2019re evaluating where there are opportunities for us to make good investments, we really think about there is a bucket of very ROIdriven headcount opportunities.\n\nWe\u2019re very rigorous about the way we think about returns there and what the return opportunity is and how -- what we think is the likelihood of those returns and what is the aggregate incrementality of those investments, and those are all things that sort of we\u2019re evaluating when we think about where to invest in the core business and where we think we can -- we can deliver sort of ROI on a nearer-term basis.\n\nAnd then at the same time, we\u2019re also assessing what the opportunities look like in some of the more medium- and long-term strategic areas of investment and that includes our efforts in Gen AI and the infrastructure needed to support it.\n\nIt includes our investments in Reality Labs. And so those are all things that we\u2019re kind of assessing in kind of a portfolio of what we could -- what we think we would do in 2025. With a couple of thoughts, one is, again, where can we sort of build the most flexibility into the way that we\u2019re thinking about either infrastructure or headcount plans.\n\nAnd the second is we\u2019re really focused across the company on our efficiency efforts broadly and making sure that we feel like we\u2019re continuing to push the whole company including areas in which we expect that we will be making additional headcount investments to think about how they can be more efficient in \u201825 than they were in \u201824.\n\n# Operator:\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n# Ross Sandler:\n\nGreat. Just two quick ones, Mark. You said something along the lines of the more standardized Llama becomes the more improvements will flow back to the core Meta business. And I guess, could you just dig in a little bit more on that? So the series of Llama models are being used by lots of developers building different things in AI.\n\nI guess, how are you using that vantage point to incubate new ideas inside Meta? And then second question is, you mentioned on one of the podcasts after the Meta Connect that assuming scaling laws hold up, we may need hundreds of billions of compute CapEx to kind of reach our goals around Gen AI.\n\nSo I guess, how quickly could you conceivably stand up that much infrastructure given some of the constraints around energy or custom ASICs or other factors? Just any more color on the speed by which we could get that amount of compute online at Meta? Thank you.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I can try to give some more color on this. I mean the improvements to Llama, I\u2019d say come in a couple of flavors. There\u2019s sort of the quality flavor and the efficiency flavor.\n\nThere are a lot of researchers and independent developers who do work and because Llama is available, they do the work on Llama and they make improvements and then they publish it and it becomes -- it\u2019s very easy for us to then incorporate that both back into Llama and into our Meta products like Meta AI or AI Studio or Business AIs because the work -- the examples that are being shown are people doing it on our stack.\n\nPerhaps more importantly is just the efficiency and cost. I mean this stuff is obviously very expensive. When someone figures out a way to run this better, if that -- if they can run it $20%$ more effectively, then that will save us a huge amount of money.\n\nAnd that was sort of the experience that we had with Open Compute and why - - part of why we are leaning so much into Open Source here in the first place, is that we found counterintuitively with Open Compute that by publishing and sharing the architectures and designs that we had for our compute, the industry standardized around it a bit more.\n\nWe got some suggestions also that helped us save costs and that just ended up being really valuable for us. Here, one of the big costs is chips -- a lot of the infrastructure there.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is that as Llama gets adopted more, you\u2019re seeing folks like NVIDIA and AMD optimize their chips more to run Llama specifically well which clearly benefits us.\n\nSo it benefits everyone who\u2019s using Llama, but it makes our products better, right, rather than if we were just on an island building a model that no one was kind of standardizing around in the industry.\n\nSo that\u2019s some of what we\u2019re seeing around Llama and why I think it\u2019s good business for us to do this in an open way.\n\nIn terms of scaling infra, I mean when I talk about our teams executing well, some of that goes towards delivering more engaging products and some of it goes towards delivering more revenue.\n\nOn the infra side, it goes towards building out the expenses faster, right? So I think part of what we\u2019re seeing this year is the infra team is executing quite well. And I think that\u2019s why, over the course of the year, we\u2019ve been able to build out more capacity.\n\nI mean going into the year, we had a range for what we thought we could potentially do. And we have been able to do, I think, more than, I think, we\u2019d kind of hoped and expected at the beginning of the year.\n\nAnd while that reflects as higher expenses, it\u2019s actually something that I\u2019m quite happy that the team is executing well on. And I think that will -- so that execution makes me somewhat more optimistic that we\u2019re going to be able to keep on building this out at a good pace but that\u2019s part of this whole thing. This is -- this part of the formula around kind of building out the infrastructure is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term that we\u2019re growing it out.\n\nBut I just think that the opportunities here are really big. We\u2019re going to continue investing significantly in this. And I\u2019m proud of the teams that are doing great work to stand up a large amount of capacity so that way we can deliver world-class models and world-class products.\n\nOperator:\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n# Ronald Josey:\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bigger picture one as well, Mark, just this time on Threads. Now one of the core apps, and on it\u2019s way to becoming the next major social app and 275 million MAUs.\n\nI wanted to hear your thoughts on how this product evolves over time, specifically from a monetization perspective, but also next steps on users? And then, Susan, with pricing up $11%$ in the quarter, I wanted to hear more about the pricing dynamics on the platform.\n\nI think you talked about just pricing increasing due to greater advertising demand and improved ad performance. So help us understand that a little bit more. Thank you.\n\n# Susan Li:\n\nThanks, Ron. So your first question was about Threads. We\u2019re making good progress there. We are continuing to launch more features and make improvements to our ranking stack. We feel very good about the continued user growth on Threads.\n\nWe\u2019re bringing on an increasing number of users each quarter and depth of engagement also continues to grow. And in Q3, we saw especially strong user growth in key markets like the U.S., Taiwan and Japan. And we -- we\u2019ve added a number of new features over the course of Q3 including account insights for businesses and creators to see how they\u2019re posts perform, the ability to save multiple drafts, continuing to deliver on our commitment to integrate Threads with the Fediverse and basically, we\u2019re very focused on continuing to build out the sort of functionality of Threads over time and being responsive to what users tell us that they\u2019re interested in.\n\nSpecifically, as it pertains to monetization, we don\u2019t expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue at this time.\n\nWe\u2019ve been just pleased with the growth trajectory and again, are really focused on introducing features that the community finds valuable and working to deepen growth and engagement. Your second question was about the increase in average price per ad.\n\nSo that grew $11%$ year-over-year, driven by strong advertiser demand and part of that is because of better ad performance over time also. And we saw that CPM growth accelerate slightly from $10%$ in Q2, in part because we experienced lower impression growth in Q3.\n\nBut more broadly, as we think about pricing growth and this metric, the yearover-year growth in reported price per ad, there\u2019s a lot that goes into that including the auction dynamics resulting from fluctuations and impression growth. And one of the things that we feel like we\u2019re very focused on is really the input metrics.\n\nWhat are the conversions that we are delivering to advertisers? Are they getting more value over time? The sort of blended reported price per ad is complicated because all of those things get rolled up into it.\n\nThere are so many different objectives that advertisers are optimizing for, those objectives have very different values that make them hard to compare on an apples-to-apples basis.\n\nBut we care a lot about conversion growth, which is growing, continues to grow faster than impression growth. And are we seeing healthy cost per action or cost per conversion trends, which we are. And as long as we continue to get better at driving conversions for advertisers, that should have the effect of lifting CPMs over time, because we\u2019re delivering more conversions per impressions served and that will result in higher value impressions.\n\n# Operator:\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\nKenneth Gawrelski: Thanks for the opportunity. I appreciate that. I have a bigger picture kind of like ecosystem question here. Is -- when we think -- I\u2019m curious, how far do you think we are from seeing a proliferation of third-party AI applications, specifically on the kind of the consumer side? I know we\u2019re seeing more and more on the enterprise side, agents, et cetera.\n\nBut when do we see -- how far out until we see a proliferation of consumer applications in the AI space? And how would you think about -- and how does Meta think of itself as one of those key applications in the mobile internet and the desktop internet? But now you\u2019re also seemingly an infrastructure player as well. So I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I mean there are a lot of consumer products that we\u2019re working on. And with Llama, I would expect that app developers will be able to build a lot of really good things, too.\n\nI\u2019ve touched on Meta AI and AI Studio and Business AIs a bunch, and I expect those to be important parts of the consumer experience. Another part that I haven\u2019t talked about quite as much yet is the opportunity for AI to help people create content that just makes people\u2019s feed experiences better.\n\nIf you look at the big trends in Feeds over the history of the company, it started off as friends, right? So all the updates that were in there were basically from your friends posting things. And then we went into this era where we added in creator content too, where now a very large percent of the content on Instagram and Facebook is not from your friends.\n\nIt may not even be from people that you\u2019re following directly. It could just be recommended content from creators that we can algorithmically determine is going to be interesting and engaging and valuable to you.\n\nAnd I think we\u2019re going to add a whole new category of content, which is AI generated or AI summarized content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way. And I think that that\u2019s going to be just very exciting for the - - for Facebook and Instagram and maybe Threads or other kind of Feed experiences over time.\n\nIt\u2019s something that, we\u2019re starting to test different things around this. I don\u2019t know if we know exactly what\u2019s going to work really well yet. Some things are promising. I don\u2019t know that -- this isn\u2019t going to be a big impact on the business in \u201825 would be my guess.\n\nBut I think that there is -- I have high confidence that over the next several years, this is going to be an important trend and one of the important applications. But you\u2019re going to get that, you\u2019re going to get Meta AI, AI Studio, business AIs and a whole lot of things that developers would do with Llama too.\n\n# Operator:\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n# Youssef Squali:\n\nYes, thank you very much. Mark, it appears that Meta AI now crawls the web and provides conversational answers about pretty much anything including current events. And so with over ten million advertisers and one of the best ROAS offerings out there in your core business, just wondering if there are any plans to start maybe testing ads on commercial queries, and move Meta AI closer to becoming a real answer engine for the billions of queries that you guys are already seeing?\n\nAnd then Susan, one of the biggest areas of pushback we get is around Reality Labs and the ongoing losses there, I think $\\\\Phi16$ billion last year, probably north of $\\\\Phi20$ billion this year. The question is, are we getting any closer to peak losses there or alternatively, what products do you think have the biggest potential there over the next couple of years? Thanks.\n\n# Susan Li:\n\nI\u2019m happy to take both of these, Youssef. So your first question was on plans to provide ads on commercial queries. I think I alluded to this maybe in a much earlier question. Right now, we\u2019re really focused on making Meta AI as engaging and valuable a consumer experience as possible.\n\nOver time, we think there will be a broadening set of queries that people use it for. And I think that the monetization opportunities will exist when -- over time as we get there.\n\nBut right now, I would say we are really focused on the consumer experience above all and this is sort of a playbook for us with products that we put out in the world where we really dial in the consumer experience before we focus on what the monetization could look like. The second part of your question is about Reality Labs.\n\nWe aren\u2019t sharing expectations beyond 2024 at this point. And we are certainly as we think about the 2025 budgeting process for Reality Labs, we\u2019re certainly thinking about where we want to make sure we\u2019re putting our sort of focus and energy.\n\nWe are very excited, again, about the progress that we\u2019ve seen with our smart glasses as well as the sort of strong consumer interest in them. And so, we\u2019re kind of thinking about where we want to make sure that we are investing appropriately behind the consumer momentum that we see.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say Reality Labs is clearly one of our strategic long-term priorities, and we expect it will be an area of significant investment in -- as we build out towards the very ambitious product roadmap that we have there.\n\n# Kenneth Dorell:\n\nKrista, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator:\n\nYour last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\n# Mark Mahaney:\n\nLet me throw in two questions, please. One, this is a year in which we\u2019ve had a lot of unusual events that could be driving ad revenue, major elections in not just the U.S., but Europe and in India and major sports events like World Cup and I know there\u2019s some other things.\n\nIs there any -- just in thinking about comps for next year and maybe in the future, anything Susan, you would call out, like how much of an impact there may have come from these one in every four or five-year events? And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit more about WhatsApp monetization and where you are with that now?\n\nIt sounds like the business messaging part is really feeding in nicely into other revenue. But help us think about where the monetization levels of WhatsApp are now versus where they can be two or three years down the road, how far away we are from optimization? Thank you.\n\n# Susan Li:\n\nThanks, Mark. So your first question was about sort of the revenue backdrop in 2024, you mentioned events that occur once every four or five years. So I imagine we\u2019re talking about the Olympics. We historically have not seen meaningful incremental contribution from events like the Olympics. We believe that was largely the case this year.\n\nSo when we think about the Q4 outlook and when we think about going into next year, we generally expect growth to continue to benefit from the healthy global advertising demand that we\u2019ve seen.\n\nWe think that our investments in improving our ads performance will continue to accrue benefits to advertisers. But obviously, there\u2019s a big range of possible macro backdrops and that\u2019s something that we try to reflect in the range of revenue guidance that we give.\n\nSo -- but I don\u2019t know that there are a lot of specific events that we would say had a material sort of idiosyncratic to 2024 type of revenue impact. Your second question was around WhatsApp monetization and where we are. And right now what I would say, again, is Click-to-Message is really the big focus area for us here.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing continued traction in this area. And in particular, growth in Clickto-WhatsApp Ads remain particularly strong. And so we\u2019re continuing to focus both on scaling Click-to-WhatsApp Ads in more markets where WhatsApp has strong user adoption like Brazil, for example.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously earlier in the U.S., but we\u2019re seeing good growth in Click-toWhatsApp Ads and are continuing to invest in scaling and consumer adoption of WhatsApp in the U.S. also, which will create bigger opportunities down the line.\n\nSo -- and then, of course, a lot of work that we\u2019re doing to make the Click-toMessaging ads more effective and helping to focus for the particular -- helping advertisers optimize, sorry, for the particular conversion events that they care about.\n\nThe other element of revenue on WhatsApp, I would say, is paid messaging.\n\nThat continues to grow at a strong pace again this quarter.\n\nIt remains, in fact, the primary driver of growth in our Family of Apps other revenue line, which was up $48%$ in Q3, and we\u2019re seeing generally a strong increase in the volume of paid conversations driven both by growth in the number of businesses adopting paid messaging as well as in the conversational volume per business.\n\n# Kenneth Dorell:\n\nGreat.

The company, once perceived as past its prime after facing revenue declines in 2022, has staged a remarkable resurgence. The Q2 2024 earnings report paints a picture of a company firing on all cylinders, with a 22% year-over-year revenue surge to $39 billion.\n\nThis impressive growth is primarily fueled by a 10% increase in both ad impressions and average price per ad, underscoring the enduring strength and effectiveness of Meta\u2019s advertising platform. [\u200b](https://steadycompounding.com/membership/)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdvf4yOrTkBdzGazrFw4lgCPA7BXfFNprLgjKe9PeC7h60rRgDA_rrVI1Zboxrp7MwfQXCil5QrusfbB5ak9U1_5VCVfQk6A0a_9Pg7MWEvmYpE2nkr3asnI00ufl144PNE7C3iVE50_KlYALEIQPYbE7h4?key=ODkSje-sD5NG-8-sWKcBmw)\n\nSource:\u00a0[Finchat](https://finchat.io/?via=sc)\u00a0(get a 15% discount u _sing\u00a0[this link](https://finchat.io/?via=sc))_\n\nThe company\u2019s robust financial health is further evident in its strong cash flow generation. Meta generated $19.4 billion in net cash from operating activities, resulting in a free cash flow of $10.9 billion after accounting for capital expenditures.\n\nThis financial strength allows the company to reward shareholders through substantial dividends and share buybacks, totaling $1.3 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.\n\nUser engagement metrics also tell a positive story. The company\u2019s family daily active people (DAP) reached 3.27 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase. Notably, CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted strong growth among young adults in the U.S., a demographic previously considered challenging for Facebook, \u201c _The growth we\u2019re seeing here in the US has especially been a bright spot\u2026 I\u2019m particularly pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making with young adults on Facebook. The numbers we\u2019re seeing, especially in the US, really go against the public narrative around who\u2019s using the app.\u201d_\n\nThe growth in the U.S. market is particularly significant as it contributes disproportionately large to Meta\u2019s overall revenue. This strong performance in its core market reinforces the company\u2019s competitive advantage, driven by its powerful network effect.\n\n## AI: The Catalyst for Meta\u2019s Resurgence\n\nMeta\u2019s foresight in investing heavily in AI, even before it became the buzzword it is today, is now paying dividends. The company\u2019s early commitment to AI, despite facing market skepticism and a declining stock price in 2022, has positioned it at the forefront of this technological revolution.\n\nAs Mark Zuckerberg articulated in Q3 2022, _\u201c_ **we are significantly expanding our AI capacity. These investments are driving substantially all of our capital expenditure growth in 2023.** _There is some increased capital intensity that comes with moving more of our infrastructure to AI. It requires more expensive servers and networking equipment, and we are building new data centers specifically equipped to support next-generation AI hardware._ **We expect these investments to provide us with a technology advantage and unlock meaningful improvements across many of our key initiatives, including Feed, Reels and Ads** _.\u201d_\n\nToday, Meta is reaping the rewards of its Zuckerberg\u2019s foresight. AI-powered enhancements in content recommendations and ad experiences across Facebook and Instagram are driving increased user engagement and more effective ad targeting. This is reflected in the impressive 10% surge in both ad impressions and average price per ad, contributing significantly to the company\u2019s revenue growth.\n\nUnlike other big tech companies that are still trying to figure out how to monetize its AI investments effectively, Meta is leveraging its AI capabilities to bolster its core advertising business. This approach allows the company to successfully monetize its AI investments effectively through increased ad revenue and better content recommendations to increase user engagements.\n\nZuckerberg envisions a future where Meta\u2019s AI-powered ad systems will surpass advertisers\u2019 own ability to identify target demographics. Moreover, AI will generate ad creatives tailored to specific audiences, streamlining the advertising process and empowering businesses to achieve their objectives with unprecedented efficiency.\n\n## Fueling Future Growth: Meta\u2019s Ambitious Investments in AI\n\nMeta has raised its full-year 2024 CapEx forecast to $37-40 billion, reflecting ongoing investments in AI research and development. The company anticipates significant CapEx growth in 2025 as it continues to build out its AI infrastructure.\n\nWhile Meta expects continued revenue growth in the third quarter, it acknowledges potential headwinds from tougher comparisons and foreign exchange fluctuations. The focus on AI and the metaverse is expected to drive substantial expense growth in 2025, primarily due to infrastructure investments.\n\nHistorically, the market has reacted with skepticism to Meta\u2019s aggressive investment phases, as seen in 2022 when the stock price suffered. However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that sustained investment is often necessary for companies to maintain their competitive edge and drive long-term shareholder value.\n\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s track record speaks for itself. He has consistently demonstrated the ability to identify and capitalize on emerging trends, as evidenced by the success of acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp. His early recognition of AI\u2019s potential and the subsequent investments in this area are now bearing fruit, driving engagement and revenue growth.\n\nWhile the market might react negatively to increased CapEx in the short term, it\u2019s essential to take a long-term perspective. The substantial investments in AI infrastructure and the metaverse are laying the groundwork for future growth and innovation. By allowing Zuckerberg the freedom to pursue his vision, Meta is positioning itself to remain at the forefront of technological advancements and capitalize on emerging opportunities, ultimately rewarding shareholders in the long run.

She said the company is keeping a \u201cclose eye\u201d on the supply of technology such as GPUs, which are key for training and running AI systems.\n\n\u201cWhere we land in that range is a function of both the supply and demand factors I mentioned,\u201d Li said. \u201cAnd this continues to be a pretty dynamic planning process for us.\u201d\n\nThere are also \u201cother factors that drive uncertainty,\u201d the Meta CFO explained. These include \"how quickly can we execute on the new data center architecture \\[and\\] how the supply chain turns out to unfold over the course of the year,\" she said.\n\nLi added: \"Our expectation is, generally, that we will need to invest more to support our AI work in the years ahead, and we're seeing some of that reflected in 2024.\"\n\n## Meta\u2019s new data center strategy\n\nMeta is [redesigning](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/how-meta-redesigned-its-data-centers-for-the-ai-era/) its data centers for the AI era, with new cooling and power management systems. It also claims to have slashed the cost of construction by 31 percent, as well as reducing construction times by half.\n\n\"We saw the writing on the wall for the potential scale of this technology about two years ago,\u201d Alan Duong, Meta\u2019s global director of data center engineering, told _DCD_ in an interview last year.\n\nSo far the company has two of the new-look data centers in the pipeline, currently [under construction](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-resumes-construction-of-texas-and-idaho-data-centers-with-new-ai-design/) in Kuna, Idaho, and Temple, Texas.\n\nMeta is also reportedly looking to use more of its own silicon in its data centers to reduce its reliance on GPUs from vendors such as Nvidia.\n\n# Subscribe to our daily newsletters\n\nThank you for subscribing to our newsletter series.\n\n## More in Investment / M&A\n\n- ![csm_Jazz_Credit_Facility_1_09c4589197](https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/csm_Jazz_Credit_Facility_1_09c4589.2e16d0ba.fill-280x185.jpg)\n\n24 Jul 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# [Veon subsidiary Jazz secures $270m loan for network upgrades in Pakistan](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/veon-subsidiary-jazz-secures-270m-loan-for-network-upgrades-in-pakistan/)\n\n- ![Xscape Photonics Technology](https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/Xscape_Photonics_Technology.2e16d0ba.fill-280x185.jpg)\n\n16 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# [Silicon photonics startup Xscape Photonics closes $44m funding round](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/silicon-photonics-startup-xscape-photonics-closes-44m-funding-round/)\n\n- ![Investment & Markets  SITE THUMBNAIL (1)](https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/Investment__Markets__SITE_THUMBNAI.2e16d0ba.fill-280x185.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Episode [Data center growth - 2025 Investment opportunities and challenges](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/broadcasts/dcd-data-center-investment-and-markets-broadcasts-2024/2024/episode-jan25/)\n\n\n## More in North America\n\n- ![DCD_Connect _ Virginia - Sample Delegate List - 2024 Leadership_page-0001](https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/DCD_Connect___Virginia_-_Sample_Delegate_List.height-150.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n# [DCD>Leadership Summit - Sample Delegate List](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/dcd-downloads/leadership-summit-24-delegate-list/)\n\n- ![tyler](https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/tyler.2e16d0ba.fill-280x185.png)\n\n23 Aug 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# [Barrio Energy acquires 12MW data center in Tyler, Texas](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/barrio-energy-acquires-12mw-data-center-in-tyler-texas/)\n\n- ![DAEC](https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/DAEC.2e16d0ba.fill-280x185.jpg)\n\n23 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# [NextEra says there's \"strong interest\" in restarting Iowa nuclear plant for data centers](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nextera-says-theres-strong-interest-in-restarting-iowa-nuclear-plant-for-data-centers/)\n\n\n[Facebook](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/#facebook) [Twitter](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/#twitter) [LinkedIn](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/#linkedin) [Reddit](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/#reddit) [Email](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/#email) [Share](https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacenterdynamics.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fmeta-plans-37bn-digital-infrastructure-investment-in-2024%2F&title=Meta%20plans%20%2437bn%20digital%20infrastructure%20investment%20in%202024%20-%20DCD)\n\n### Tags\n\n- [Meta](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/tags/meta/)\n- [Facebook](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/tags/facebook_1/)\n- [artificial intelligence](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/tags/artificial-intelligence/)\n- [AI](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/tags/ai/)\n- [capex](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/tags/capex/)\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\n[AddToAny](https://www.addtoany.com/ \"Share Buttons\")\n\n[More\u2026](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-plans-37bn-digital-infrastructure-investment-in-2024/#addtoany \"Show all\")\n\nTopics Frame",

Meta's stock price hit a record on Dec. 11.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tries on Orion AR glasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 25, 2024. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\n\nManuel Orbegozo \\| Reuters\n\n\"Aut Zuck Aut Nihil\" spanned the front of Mark Zuckerberg's loose-fitting black shirt during his keynote at Meta's Connect event in September.\n\nThe words, donned in all-caps and gray font, were a play on the Latin phrase \"Aut Caesar Aut Nihil,\" which translates to \"Either Caesar or nothing\" or rather \"All or nothing.\" It was a fitting phrase for a company that in 2024 put the full weight of its resources behind its artificial intelligence strategy.\n\nMeta in April said it would [raise its spending levels](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-loses-200-billion-in-value-zuckerberg-focuses-on-ai-metaverse.html) in 2024 by as much as $10 billion to support infrastructure investments for its AI efforts. Although the announcement [sent shares plunging](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-meta-q1-2024-earnings-.html) as much as 19% that evening, investors have come around to the company's costly AI ambitions. Meta's stock price hit a [record](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/alphabet-and-tesla-reach-fresh-records-joining-amazon-and-meta-.html) on Dec. 11, and it's up nearly 70% year to date as of the market's close on Friday.\n\n\"It's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there,\" [Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) said on a call with analysts in October.\n\nHe noted AI's \"positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work,\" highlighting how the technology was key to rebuilding the company's online advertising business that took a lashing from [Apple](/quotes/AAPL/)'s iOS privacy update in 2021. Additionally, he said AI underpins Meta's more nascent projects, such as its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and experimental [Orion augmented reality headset](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/meta-finally-finds-success-in-ar-vr-three-years-after-changing-name.html) that Zuckerberg believes could represent \"the next computing platform.\"\n\nZuckerberg's comments about AI underscore how the technology has become Meta's top priority, directly impacting the company's business and potentially paving the way for future revenue opportunities. Unlike the company's more conventional services, like Instagram and Facebook, AI is an infrastructure technology that Zuckerberg wants hardwired into its various products, particularly as competitors like OpenAI continue to make inroads with consumers.\n\nWhile OpenAI's GPT family of AI models help power apps like ChatGPT, Meta's [family of Llama AI models](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/metas-open-source-approach-to-ai-puzzles-wall-street-techies-love-it.html) feeds the company's newer generative AI features like the Meta AI digital assistant. That chatbot represents Zuckerberg's primary way to introduce generative AI technologies to its billions of users.\n\n\"Meta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year,\" Zuckerberg said at Connect.\n\nThe company has been increasingly releasing new generative AI features for advertisers to continue improving the efficiency of its online advertising platform. And with the hiring last month of Clara Shih, who had been [Salesforce's](/quotes/CRM/) CEO of AI, to lead a new business AI group, Meta aims to build a more enterprise-focused unit in the new year.\n\nThe Meta AI logo is being displayed on a smartphone in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on June 10, 2024.\n\nJonathan Raa \\| Nurphoto \\| Getty Images\n\nMeta's all-encompassing approach to AI has led analysts to predict that Meta is positioned for more success in 2025.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies chose Meta as one of generative AI's \"winners\" heading into 2025, writing in a Dec. 15 note that the company's massive user base represents \"one of the richest surfaces to introduce Gen AI tools.\" Truist Securities analysts said in a note last week that the Meta AI digital assistant could challenge Google's search as \"an answer engine for all kinds of queries\" and that the social media company is likely to outperform in 2025, potentially benefiting from offering businesses more advanced customer service chatbots.\n\n\"We believe META has a unique opportunity to introduce Gen AI tools to the almost 4B users & >200M businesses across its family of apps,\" the Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nMeta declined to comment for this article, but pointed to previous statistics and executive comments about AI.\n\n## Meta AI's expanding user base\n\nMeta has been increasingly talking up the number of people who use Meta AI, with Zuckerberg saying in December that the digital assistant \"now has nearly 600 million monthly actives.\"\n\nHe launched the Meta AI chatbot in 2023 to rival the generative AI chatbots of competitors, most notably OpenAI's ChatGPT. In April, the company brought it to the forefront of each of the apps in its empire by putting Meta AI in the search bars of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nBut because the company doesn't offer a stand-alone Meta AI app, it's difficult to directly compare its usage to similar services like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, said David Curry, the data editor for insights firm Business of Apps.\n\nWhen it comes to monthly active users, the most popular of these generative AI chatbot apps is ChatGPT by a wide margin, followed by [Google](/quotes/GOOGL/) Gemini, [Microsoft](/quotes/MSFT/) Copilot, Claude and Perplexity, Curry said.\n\nThe Meta AI \"standalone website gets less than 10 million views per month, putting it far below the major services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) and even lower than some mid-range players like Anthropic,\" Curry said, based on data he accessed via the Similarweb web-tracking service.\n\nMeta's finance chief, Susan Li, [told](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/META-Q2-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf) analysts in July that India has become the company's \"largest market for Meta AI usage.\" That usage has coincided with promising signs of [retention and engagement on WhatsApp](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/metas-whatsapp-is-chasing-big-businesses-to-capitalize-on-popularity.html), Li added.\n\nTourists are seen at the forecourt of the iconic Gateway of India as a digital display of messaging app WhatsApp is displayed, in Mumbai on August 25, 2023.\n\nIndranil Mukherjee \\| AFP \\| Getty Images\n\nAmong those users is Sonny Ravan,a music producer in Pune, India. Ravan said he finds Meta AI, which he uses through WhatsApp, helpful for learning about the history of songs that he enjoys. He also uses it as a tool to learn about people in the music industry who he plans to work with or meet, describing it as great for preparation.\n\nSathish Thiyagarajan, 30, a technical support engineer for marketing tech firm GoX.AI, said he's increasingly using Meta AI as a search tool via WhatsApp, which he noted dominates the Indian market for mobile internet communications.\n\n\"While I'm talking with my family or my friends, if they're saying something to me and I have to search something, I'm not going to go to Google,\" said Thiyagarajan, of Chennai, India. \"I'm just going to put the phone in the speaker mode, and I'll immediately search through Meta AI.\"\n\nHowever, Thiyagarajan said he only uses Meta AI when he's on his phone. If he's at his computer, OpenAI's ChatGPT is his preferred AI chatbot.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of Meta AI's bundling into WhatsApp's search functions.\n\nJawhar Sircar, 72 **,** a retired government official in Kolkata, India, called the Meta AI search feature in WhatsApp \"quite a nuisance.\" That's because whenever a user pauses while typing out a name in the search-find box, the Meta AI technology quickly \"picks up whatever has been typed\" and generates what he describes as unnecessary search prompt suggestions.\n\nAs far as the popularity of Meta AI in India, Sircar said he thinks the feature is mostly used by companies, technologists and other professionals who \"are getting hooked to AI\" alongside the Indian government's continued investment in regional computing infrastructure.\n\n\"Professionals and companies have started using AI, but the general user has no need, at least not on the Meta platforms,\" Sircar wrote in an email.\n\n## Meta's AI strategy for advertisers\n\nAdvertising is still the key to revenue.\n\nMeta\u00a0[said](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/02/production-engineering/meta-andromeda-advantage-automation-next-gen-personalized-ads-retrieval-engine/)\u00a0in December that over 1 million advertisers had used the company's GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in a single month.\n\n\"We estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a +7% increase in conversions,\" Meta said at the time, regarding its image generation features.\n\nWhile people may [associate generative AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/08/how-the-generative-ai-boom-could-forever-change-online-advertising.html) with the visually striking and sometimes surreal imagery derived from popular services like Dall-E or Midjourney, it's more likely that the average small business advertiser uses Meta's GenAI tools for more subtle tasks, said Stacy Reed, an online advertising and Facebook ads consultant.\n\nThat includes using AI to create multiple versions of an ad's headline, auto-resizing the size of ads so they look appropriate within users' Instagram and Facebook apps, and repositioning certain images within the ads so that the promotions perform better, Reed said.\n\nAdvertisers that already write strong, creative copy can ask Meta's GenAI tools for \"a little bit more\" help, Reed said.\n\n\"That's where you win with their AI tools,\" she said.\n\nReed said the many small advertisers she supports aren't associating the new features with AI. They \"think that Meta is just enhancing the way you build ads,\" Reed said.\n\n![How Meta's $19 billion bet on WhatsApp could finally start paying off](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107294825-1693541615805-GettyImages-1001511110.jpg?v=1694771657&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:0610:06\n\nHow Meta's $19 billion bet on WhatsApp could finally start paying off\n\n[Tech](https://www.cnbc.com/technology/)\n\nCelina Guerrero, an independent corporate sales and training consultant, said she uses Meta's GenAI tools to help with writing headlines for her ads, but she said she finds Meta's advertising interface to be confusing and constantly changing.\n\n\"It is visually overwhelming from a user experience,\" Guerrero said.\n\nAhead of a Facebook ad campaign planned for January, Guerrero said she is debating how to use Meta's GenAI tools for more in-depth tasks, like modifying her ad's entire in-line copy.\n\n\"I don't want my copy to sound like ChatGPT,\" Guerrero said, referring to the sterile, run-of-the-mill AI-generated text that's proliferating the web. \"I have two options: One, I don't use the variations, or two, I spend an inordinate amount of hours editing it.\"\n\nMost big companies and advertising agencies are turning to more marketing-specific tools for their generative AI-based ad campaigns, said Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester. Those services are more robust than Meta's built-in AI ad tools, he said.\n\nStill, the mere introduction of simple GenAI tools is beneficial to Metaconsidering it dominates the digital ads market along with Google. Meta's generative AI tools just have \"to be good enough to squeeze out more investment\" from advertisers, said Maurice Rahmey, CEO of performance marketing firm Disruptive Digital and a former Facebook customer manager.\n\n\"It's better for their business, even if it's just those small, incremental changes,\" Rahmey said \"It's a business of scale.\"\n\nClara Shih, Former CEO of Salesforce AI\n\nBloomberg \\| Bloomberg \\| Getty Images\n\n## What's next for Meta's enterprise play?\n\nWith Meta's hiring of Shih from Salesforce in November, some analysts say Meta could make an enterprise technology push with its [Llama family of open-source AI models](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/metas-open-source-approach-to-ai-puzzles-wall-street-techies-love-it.html).\n\nLlama's advancements \"represent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers,\" Meta monetization head John Hegeman said in a statement.\n\nShih, who was one of [CNBC's 2024 changemakers](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/clara-shih-cnbc-changemakers.html), rejoined Salesforce in 2020 after previously working at the company from 2006 through 2009. As part of her most recent role at Salesforce, Shih helped oversee Einstein GPT for Service and Sales, a GenAI product intended for sales and customer support staff.\n\nDuring her first stint at Salesforce, Shih created a business app that let users connect their Salesforce customer relationship software with their Facebook connections. In 2009, she wrote \"The Facebook Era,\" a book intended for professionals to better understand how to use social networks for business.\n\nMultiple former Meta AI and product leaders told CNBC that Shih's vast experience will be helpful considering the company has failed in previous attempts at building enterprise software.\n\nMeta [announced](https://www.facebook.com/help/1167689491269151/) in May that it plans to shut down Workplace, its business communications product, by 2026. And after buying enterprise startup Kustomer for about $1 billion in 2020, Meta spun it out in 2023 in a deal that was [reportedly](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-strikes-deal-to-divest-itself-of-kustomer-8e945431) valued at $250 million.\n\nThe most logical step for Meta would be to create a [larger business around WhatsApp](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/metas-whatsapp-is-chasing-big-businesses-to-capitalize-on-popularity.html), said Ralph Schackart, an internet equity analyst at investment bank William Blair. Specifically, WhatsApp could help businesses build customer-service chatbots using Meta's GenAI, Schackart said.\n\n\"Longer term, this is going to evolve into customized sales agents, which is a $3 trillion-plus industry,\" Schackart said about Meta's WhatsApp business AI chatbot opportunity.\n\n**WATCH**: [If the U.S. bans TikTok, China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/12/06/if-the-u-s-bans-tiktok-china-could-retaliate-and-target-tesla-and-apple-deepwaters-gene-munster.html).\n\n![If the U.S. bans TikTok China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple: Deepwater's Gene Munster](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108072817-17335249551733524950-37440314808-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1733524953&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:2304:23\n\nIf the U.S. bans TikTok China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple: Deepwater's Gene Munster\n\n[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fastmoney/)",

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\n- **Costs and expenses** \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\n- **Capital expenditures**\u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\n- **Capital return program**\u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\n- **Cash, cash** **equivalents, and marketable securities** \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\n- **Long-term debt** \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\n- **Headcount**\u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\n**CFO Outlook Commentary**\n\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends.

Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\n_Foreign exchange effect on revenue_. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\n_Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases._ We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

The technology company owns three of the four biggest platforms by monthly active users (Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram). Its growing family of apps is a huge moneymaker. Meta also has a virtual experiences technology platform focused on the metaverse.\n\n![A graphic showing the logos of the companies that Meta owns.](https://m.foolcdn.com/media/dubs/images/what-does-meta-own-infographic.width-880.png)\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool\n\nThe tech titan built its platforms through organic investment and acquisitions. Meta has purchased several notable companies over the years that form the foundation of some of its most popular apps and products. Meta Platforms will likely continue to buy companies as it acquires talent and products to grow its business platforms. Future deals could make it an even better company [to invest money in](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/).\n\nHere's a look at some of the notable companies Meta owns and ones that the [social media company](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/social-media-stocks/) might acquire in the future.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/META.png)\n\n## [NASDAQ: META](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/meta/)\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-1.16%) -$7.17\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$610.72\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m\n6m\n\n\n+15.58%\n\n\n1y5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nMETA\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$1,541B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$602.79 - $616.44\n\n52wk Range\n\n$358.61 - $638.40\n\nVolume\n\n10,085,846\n\nAvg Vol\n\n12,069,096\n\nGross Margin\n\n81.50%\n\nDividend Yield\n\n0.33\n\n## What companies does Meta own?\n\nMeta Platforms is one of the world's largest [technology companies](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/). It has two business segments:\n\n- **Family of Apps**: Meta Platforms owns several [social media](https://www.fool.com/terms/s/social-media/) platforms that generate revenue from advertising and other sources.\n- **Reality Labs**: The company also has a business and research unit that produces hardware and software for [virtual reality](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/virtual-reality-stocks/) (VR) and [augmented reality](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/augmented-reality-stocks/) (AR). This segment also focuses on [artificial intelligence](https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/) (AI) and the [metaverse](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/metaverse/).\n\nThe company generates almost all of its revenue from advertising (98% of its $134.9 billion in 2023). Meanwhile, its family of apps produces all of its profits ($21 billion in operating income in 2023 vs. a $4.6 billion operating loss for Reality Labs).\n\nHere's a look at some of the notable companies Meta Platforms owns.\n\n### 1\\. Facebook\n\n[Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/top-ceos/mark-zuckerberg/) co-founded [Facebook](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-facebook-stock/) in 2004 (originally FaceMash and then TheFacebook). It was the biggest social media platform in the world in early 2024, with more than 3 billion monthly active users. Facebook is now part of Meta's family of apps business after the social technology company rebranded to Meta Platforms in 2021 to reflect its growing platform and focus on the metaverse.\n\n### 2\\. Beluga (Now Facebook Messenger)\n\nFacebook acquired group messaging service Beluga for an undisclosed sum in 2011. The company used Beluga to help bolster its instant messaging platform, which is now Facebook Messenger. It's the seventh-largest social media platform with the potential to reach an estimated 979 million people with advertising. Facebook Messenger is part of Meta's family of apps business unit.\n\n### 3\\. WhatsApp\n\nFacebook bought messaging company WhatsApp in 2014 for $16 billion in cash and stock. At the time, 450 million people used it on any given day. WhatsApp has grown into the third-largest social media platform as of early 2024, behind Facebook and YouTube, with at least 2 billion monthly active users.\n\n### 4\\. Instagram\n\nFacebook bought the popular photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock in 2012. That acquisition has been a smashing success for the company. Instagram was right behind WhatsApp as the fourth-largest social media platform globally, with 2 billion monthly active users. It was the world's most popular downloaded app in December 2023, with 54 million downloads.\n\n### 5\\. Reels\n\nThe company launched Instagram Reels in 2020 to compete against social video sites like YouTube and TikTok. The app is part of Instagram. Users can also watch and share Reels on Facebook and its messenger apps.\n\n### 6\\. Threads\n\nMeta Platforms launched the text-sharing app Threads in 2023. The team behind Instagram built the app to compete with Twitter (now X). Threads had more than 130 million monthly active users as of early 2024. Meta aims to grow Threads to 1 billion users in the future. Threads was the sixth-most-popular downloaded app in December 2023.\n\n### 7\\. Oculus VR\n\nFacebook bought Oculus VR for $2 billion in cash and stock in 2014. Oculus was a leader in immersive VR technology. Oculus VR is now part of Meta's Reality Labs business unit. The company has developed several VR headsets, including Meta Quest 3.\n\n### 8\\. Reality Labs\n\nFacebook formed Reality Labs in 2020, combining its VR and AR hardware and software, including Oculus, Portal (discontinued), and Spark AR. Meta is investing heavily in [research and development](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/research-and-development/) (R&D) in Reality Labs on new products, including Project Aria (smart glasses), AI, and the metaverse (Horizon Worlds).\n\nReality Labs hasn't been a major revenue driver for Meta (revenue declined from $2.2 billion in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2023). It's also losing a significant amount of money ($16.1 billion in 2023 and $13.7 billion in 2022). However, Meta is investing heavily in the business because it believes Reality Labs can eventually become a meaningful contributor to its results.\n\n## What companies could Meta buy in the future?\n\nMeta Platforms has made more than 100 acquisitions over the years. Most of these acquisitions have been to buy talent, not products or companies. It will buy start-ups to bring their founders into the Meta family.\n\nHowever, Meta will make product acquisitions when it finds a compelling opportunity. Notable ones include its purchases of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR.\n\nThe company certainly has the financial firepower to continue making big deals. It ended 2023 with $65.4 billion of cash against $18.4 billion of debt. Meanwhile, it has become a cash-generating machine. It produced $43 billion in [free cash flow](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/free-cash-flow/) during 2023, giving the social media giant the cash to repurchase shares and pay dividends.\n\nThe company could expand its family of apps by acquiring rival social media platforms. For example, while it has launched competitors to [TikTok](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/social-media-stocks/tiktok/) (Reels) and [X](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/who-owns-x/) (Threads), they haven't been as successful as those rivals (TikTok can potentially reach 1.6 billion adults over 18 each month while X has the potential advertising reach of 619 million). Meta could seek to acquire those rival apps if they become available. For example, the U.S. government wants TikTok's Chinese owner to sell its U.S. operations or face a shutdown. Meta would likely be interested in buying the app if it was for sale. Meanwhile, [Elon Musk](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/famous-investors/elon-musk-investments/who-is-elon-musk/), who currently owns X, said he would be willing to sell the app to the right person. Although that's likely not Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, it's not outside the realm of possibility that Meta would be interested in buying the platform.\n\nOther potential social media app acquisition targets Meta might consider are [**Snap**](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-snap/) ([SNAP](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/snap/) -4.06%), a camera-focused technology communications company, and [**Pinterest**](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-pinterest-stock/) ([PINS](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/pins/) -2.96%), a visual discovery company. Snap is the 10th-largest social media platform, with 750 million monthly active users, while Pinterest clocks in at No. 15 with 482 million. Buying either company would enable Meta to expand its family of apps. Its expertise in monetizing social apps could enable it to maximize the profitability of a company like Snap or Pinterest.\n\nHowever, buying another app could prove difficult from a regulatory perspective since Meta is already the biggest social media company with three of the four most popular apps. For example, Meta acquired the popular Giphy platform for sharing animated images in messaging apps in 2020 for $315 million. However, due to anti-competitive concerns, the U.K. Competition and Market Authority ordered the company to sell that app in 2022. It took a huge loss by selling it to **Shutterstock** ([SSTK](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/sstk/) -11.1%) for $53 million. Given the likelihood of regulatory pushback if it tried to buy another social media company, Meta might opt to focus on deals that grow its Reality Labs unit, though even purchases in that space could be tough to get past regulators.\n\nThe most likely approach is to continue acquiring talent by purchasing small start-ups that fly under the radar of regulators. However, if Meta wanted to make a more impactful acquisition, it could seek to acquire a gaming company like **Roblox** ([RBLX](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/rblx/) 1.22%) or [Epic Games](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-epic-games/). Roblox launched Meta Quest VR headsets last year, providing gamers with an immersive experience in the metaverse. Meanwhile, Epic Games is becoming a major player in the metaverse, so it would also be a potential fit for Meta's strategy. Buying a large gaming company could help turn Reality Labs from a money-losing business into a more profitable venture. While both Roblox and Epic Games are currently losing money, they're growing fast (and Roblox is producing positive cash flow). By combining a gaming company with Reality Labs, Meta could leverage the increased scale to turn that entity into a more profitable venture.\n\nAnother option Meta could consider is making acquisitions to build its AI capabilities. The company launched several AI experiences across its family of Apps and devices last year. One of the tools it's seeking to build is AI for businesses and creators. It could potentially accelerate its AI ambitions by acquiring a company like [Canva](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-canva-stock/).\n\n## Related investing topics\n\n[**How to Research Stocks** \\\\\nGood research can help investors find the best companies to invest in.](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-research-stocks/)\n\n[**9 Best ESG Funds of 2025** \\\\\nThese funds invest in companies that score high on ESG metrics.

That will make it more challenging for the company to make additional acquisitions in the sector. However, Meta has other avenues to grow, including making deals to expand its gaming and AI capabilities. A meaningful acquisition that could turn Reality Labs from a money pit into a profit machine could help Meta create a lot of value for its investors in the future, making it an even better [stock to buy and hold](https://www.fool.com/terms/b/buy-and-hold-strategy/).\n\n## FAQ on companies Meta owns\n\n### What companies does Meta own?\n\nangle-downangle-up\n\nMeta owns several companies.

The social media giant Meta plans to inject large sums from its booming advertising revenue into artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual worlds, according to its financial report published on 30 October. Jens B\u00fcttner/dpa\n\nThe social media giant Meta plans to inject large sums from its booming advertising revenue into artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual worlds, according to its financial report published on Wednesday.\n\nThe report states that the company plans to allocate at least $38 billion to long-term investments in AI this year, including for the expansion of data centres - $1 billion more than previously expected.\n\nSpending on AI projects is then set to increase further next year.\n\nMeta is gradually integrating AI software, which can create text or images, into its apps, including Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe company records 500 million monthly users of Meta AI, which according to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, is already having a positive impact on the company's business.\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg has already accepted losses of more than $50 billion for his vision of virtual worlds, in which people are to work and spend their free time.\n\nIn the last quarter alone, the company's Reality Labs division - responsible for the virtual worlds venture - reported an operating loss of $4.4 billion, with only $270 million in revenue.\n\nNonetheless, Meta chief financial officer Susan Li said the company would continue to invest heavily in the Reality Labs venture as a long-term strategic priority.\n\nReality Labs is best known for virtual reality glasses. Meta is currently trying to tap into a broader market for the product with a new, more affordable model, the Quest 3S.\n\nZuckerberg is also betting on ordinary-looking glasses that contain a camera and small speakers, which are designed to provide the AI software with context for user queries.\n\nMeta is also developing glasses that can superimpose digital objects onto the real environment for the wearer.\n\nIt is able to fund these expenses thanks to its flourishing advertising revenues.\n\nEven after the huge loss by Reality Labs, the company's net income for the third quarter rose by 35% to around $15.7 billion year-on-year. Consolidated revenue meanwhile grew by 19% to $40.6 billion.\n\nA total of 3.29 billion users access at least one of Meta's apps every day.\n\nAccording to the financial report, Meta is expecting a turnover of $45 billion to $48 billion for the current quarter. The market had expected a turnover of around $46 billion on average. The share price fell by around 3% in after-hours trading.\n\nView Comments\n\n[Terms](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n* * *\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying",

The company\u2019s FoA division is the primary reason for the growth.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61841000-5f83-4afd-ad01-611fb1a2c522_1039x337.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61841000-5f83-4afd-ad01-611fb1a2c522_1039x337.png)\n\nAs of Q2 2024, Meta Platforms has approximately a 20% market share of the U.S. digital advertising market. That puts the company behind Microsoft and Google (Alphabet Inc) at the current time.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d884c21-156f-4b01-8601-bcbe34aa42de_498x562.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d884c21-156f-4b01-8601-bcbe34aa42de_498x562.png) Source: https://www.emarketer.com/content/meta-ad-share-more-than-share-of-time-spent\n\nThat performance is strongly linked to the strong performance of Meta\u2019s Family of Apps, as its Reality Labs segment is still operating at a loss.\n\n**Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)**\n\nMeta\u2019s FoA is its Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger social media apps.\n\nMeta Platforms' revenue continues to increase thanks to its platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIt increased 22% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024, leading to a net income of $13.45 billion.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4a2898-6cdb-4ad2-87d2-99e30fd127e0_1806x616.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c4a2898-6cdb-4ad2-87d2-99e30fd127e0_1806x616.png)\n\n**Reality Labs**\n\nReality Labs is a division of Meta that focuses on the research, development, and sales of Virtual and Augmented reality technology.\n\nMeta\u2019s Reality Labs division reported losses of $4.48 billion for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nHowever, as the technology is still relatively new and expensive, this is as expected. As tech evolves, prices become more affordable, and adoption increases, there is a strong belief this segment will contribute more positively toward Meta\u2019s financial results.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7587a05-b020-4b38-b1c8-3bfc737de640_1109x496.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7587a05-b020-4b38-b1c8-3bfc737de640_1109x496.png)\n\nMeta heavily relies on the robust business model of its family of apps. Facebook, in particular, has enjoyed monumental growth in the last decade, and the company expects this growth to continue.\n\n#### **Growth Drivers \ud83d\udcc8**\n\nSeveral growth drivers contribute to Meta Platform\u2019s continued expansion. Let\u2019s get into each:\n\n1. **Advertising Revenue:**\n\n   - Facebook generated $134.9 billion in revenue during 2023, with its mobile app bringing in around $71 billion ( [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/#:~:text=Facebook's%20annual%20revenue%20increased%20by%2015.6%25%20in%202023%20to%20%24134.9%20billion.)).\n\n   - Ad impressions delivered across Meta\u2019s FoA increased by 10% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024 ( [Meta](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx)).\n\n   - The average price per ad also increased by 10% year-over-year ( [Meta](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx)).\n2. **User Base Expansion:**\n\n   - The Family Daily Active People (DAP) across those platforms for the period reached 3.27 billion, up 7%.\n\n   - According to Statista, as of April 2024, Meta\u2019s FoA has 8 billion active users, including Facebook (3,5 billion), Instagram (2.5 billion), WhatsApp (2 billion), and Messenger (1 billion).\n\n   - To compare, YouTube has 2,504 billion active users, while TikTok and Twitter stats show 1,582 billion and 611 million, respectively.\n3. **E-commerce Integration:**\n\n   - Meta has created additional revenue streams from its FoA by integrating e-commerce features across many platforms. Businesses use these platforms to sell products and services directly to users.\n\n**10-Year Growth Rates**\n\nAs the popularity of Meta\u2019s social media platforms has increased over the past decade, so has its revenue. In 2014, the company reported an approximate revenue of $12.47 billion. Fast-forward 10 years to 2024, and the conglomerate\u2019s revenue is predicted to be around $150 billion.\n\nMeta Platforms' revenue has compounded by 30.21% in the last decade. Earnings Per Share have grown 35.28% CAGR, free cash flow per share has grown 26.17%, and return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged above 30%, indicating a formidable business model at Meta.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb090a99a-b28d-495e-bad4-153ccb5d79b6_1600x572.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb090a99a-b28d-495e-bad4-153ccb5d79b6_1600x572.png)\n\n#### **Competitive advantage (Moat) \ud83c\udff0**\n\nMeta Platforms have a wide economic moat, with intangible assets and network effects being their moat sources.\n\n**Network Effects**\n\nMeta benefits from network effects due to its large and popular user base across several social media platforms and apps.\n\n- **User Growth:** As Meta\u2019s social media platforms attract more users, the network's value increases, making it more attractive for future sign-ups. As of 2024, the Daily Active People (DAP) using Meta's apps increased to 3.27 billion, 200 million more than the previous year.\n\n- **Data Accumulation: As more users join Meta\u2019s platforms, more data is collected, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of its advertising services.**\n\n- **Barriers to Entry:** Meta\u2019s social media platforms' sheer size and popularity make it increasingly difficult for competitors to enter the market. Replicating such a successful and extensive network is difficult and expensive.\n\n\n**Intangible Assets**\n\nMeta Platforms boasts a strong portfolio of intangible assets, primarily driven by its brand recognition and the user data it has collected.\n\n- **User Data:** The company has collected vast user data across its FoA. That data appeals to advertisers, allowing them to create highly personalized advertising campaigns targeting specific demographics with their products and services.\n\n- **Brand Recognition: Facebook is one of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. As of March 2024, it had a 45.5% market share based on the share of social media website visits ( [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265773/market-share-of-the-most-popular-social-media-websites-in-the-us/)).**\n\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7149cd68-988f-41ae-a23b-e32ac3c41f25_889x573.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7149cd68-988f-41ae-a23b-e32ac3c41f25_889x573.png)\n\n- **Technology and algorithms:** Meta has invested in and continues to invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. These improve user experience and further increase the effectiveness of their advertising services.\n\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 intangible assets and network effects are its strongest competitive advantages.\n\nThose moat sources allow Meta to maintain a competitive edge over its competitors in the social media, marketing, and digital advertising sectors.\n\n#### **Management \ud83d\udd74\ud83c\udffb**\n\nKey executives and their insider holdings:\n\n1. **Mark Elliot Zuckerberg**\n\n   - **Title:** Co-founder, Chairman, CEO, and Member of the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\n\n   - **Ownership: 344.52M shares**\n\n   - **Market Value of Shares: $168.74B**\n\n   - **Tenure: 20 years (since 2004)**\n\n   - **CEO Since: 2004**\n\n   - **Track Record: Led Meta from the beginning and through all significant growth phases, such as the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.**\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8063cf0-c7c6-41ac-b5c6-5f7ac168053e_1600x1066.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8063cf0-c7c6-41ac-b5c6-5f7ac168053e_1600x1066.png)\n\n2. **Sheryl Kara Sandberg**\n\n   - **Title:** Former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Meta Platforms, Inc.\n\n   - **Ownership: 1.27M shares**\n\n   - **Market Value of Shares: $621.99M**\n\n   - **Tenure: 14 years at Meta (2008\u20132022).**\n\n   - **COO Since: 2008 to 2022**\n\n   - **Track Record: Sandberg is lauded for her pivotal role in scaling Facebook\u2019s advertising business.**\n3. **Christopher K. Cox**\n\n   - **Title: Chief Product Officer of Meta Platforms, Inc.**\n\n   - **Ownership: 397.98K shares**\n\n   - **Market Value of Shares: $194.93M**\n\n   - **Tenure: Joined in 2005, with a brief departure in 2019, and returned in 2020.**\n\n   - **Track Record: Cox played a leading role in developing Facebook\u2019s News Feed.**\n\nFacebook has marked its 20th birthday, and what stands out is that most of its key executives have worked with the company for at least half that time. They each also hold significant shares in the business, although the others pale in comparison to Zuckerberg\u2019s 344.52M.\n\nOf course, as one of the company's founders, Zuckerberg has remained a key figure since its founding.\n\nIn the Second Quarter 2024 Results [Conference Call](https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/583765285) hosted by Kenneth Dorell, a Director of Meta, Zuckerberg stated that what's pleased him most is the increase in young adults using Facebook and the steady growth of a new platform, Threads.\n\nThis focus on young adults via Facebook and a trendy new solution should help Meta maintain a competitive edge despite the rapid rise of competitor platforms.\n\n**Risk Factors \u274c**\n\nThe main risks for Meta Platforms:\n\n**Regulatory and Legal Challenges:** Meta has consistently faced backlash from regulators and consumers for several reasons. Data privacy, content moderation, and antitrust issues are the common causes of complaints.\n\nThese challenges could eventually lead to regulatory fines or restrictions or potentially forced changes to Meta\u2019s business practices.\n\n**Dependence on Advertising Revenue:** Another risk is the company\u2019s reliance on an advertising revenue model. Significant economic downturns could result in businesses spending less on advertising.\n\nFurthermore, the continued rise of competitors, specifically TikTok in recent years, could also threaten that ad revenue.\n\n**Technological Disruption:** The rate of technological advances is another risk to the long-term success of Meta\u2019s social media platforms. Trends constantly shift, and the company could struggle to stay relevant.\n\nThe rapid rise of TikTok is a prime example. The social media platform has experienced a meteoric rise in users and is proving increasingly popular with Gen Z and the Alpha generation.\n\n**Valuation Risk**\n\n- **Relative Valuation:** Meta is trading at a P/E ratio of approximately 27, below its median of 29.46. Although the median PE is high, we saw Meta Platforms trade at 8.5 times earnings in 2022.\n\n- Furthermore, Meta faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny concerning privacy practices, which could impact its ability to maintain high growth rates.\n\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63366351-974f-45a6-8234-e0e23846ccd6_1080x1156.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63366351-974f-45a6-8234-e0e23846ccd6_1080x1156.jpeg)\n\nTired of\u00a0**boring**,\u00a0**text-heavy**\u00a0investing newsletters?\n\nMy good friend\u00a0**[Carbon Finance](https://www.carbonfinance.io/subscribe)**\u00a0sends out a\u00a0**weekly visual newsletter**\u00a0with the\u00a0**most important** infographics, insights, and insider trades.\n\nIt\u2019s\u00a0**completely free** and only takes\u00a0**5 minutes to\u00a0read**.\n\nJoin\u00a0**16,500+**\u00a0investors!\u00a0**Click\u00a0the\u00a0button**\u00a0below to **subscribe now**\n\n[Subscribe Here](https://www.carbonfinance.io/subscribe)\n\n* * *\n\n### Valuation \u2696\ufe0f\n\n**Multiple Comparisons**\n\nMeta Platforms is trading at a PE of 27x earnings, lower than its median of 29.46 and considerably lower than its highest\u00a0PE range of 109.4 times.\n\nThese figures indicate that the current P/E ratio is close to its 10-year median P/E.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ccd0c6e-4dea-4667-b313-1f61b6e19cda_1807x542.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ccd0c6e-4dea-4667-b313-1f61b6e19cda_1807x542.png)\n\nThe Free Cash Flow Yield is 3.72% vs. its historical median of 3.32%.\n\nThis indicates Meta generates significant free cash flow relative to its stock price.

(META): A Strong Contender for Long-Term Investment in 2024\n\nMaham Fatima\n\nSun, Oct 20, 2024, 12:12 PM7 min read\n\n## In This Article:\n\n[META \\\\\n-1.16%](/quote/META/ \"META\")\n\n[^GSPC \\\\\n+0.16%](/quote/%5EGSPC/ \"^GSPC\")\n\nWe recently published a list of **[7 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2024](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/7-best-american-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-in-2024-1373934/)**. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.\n\n## Neutral Stance Amid Uncertainties\n\nThe tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nAs sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the\u00a0[**10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-most-profitable-nasdaq-stocks-to-invest-in-1368253/), where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector\u2019s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here\u2019s an excerpt from his sentiment:\n\n> \u201c\u2026This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.\n\nKatie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Closing Bell\u2019 on October 17 and highlighted that there\u2019s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment.\n\nWhen asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500\u2019s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance.\n\nRegarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment.\n\nOn the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines.\n\nHer insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.\n\n_**Methodology**_\n\nTo find the best American stocks, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( [**s** **ee more details here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/undervalued-ai-stock-poised-for-massive-gains-10000-upside-12/)).\n\n![Meta Platforms Inc. (META): A Strong Contender for Long-Term Investment in 2024](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (META): A Strong Contender for Long-Term Investment in 2024\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\n### Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: [**META**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META))\n\n**_Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219_**\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a multinational technology company that focuses on social media and online communication, best known for its flagship social networking platform, Facebook. It also owns other popular social media apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The mission is to connect people around the world and build communities.\n\nThe company\u2019s AI-enhanced advertising and business user monetization led to Q2 2024 ad growth twice that of Google, despite higher ad costs. Daily active users rose 7%, while earnings per share surged 73% and revenue increased 22.10% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a 10% increase in ads served and cost per ad. It acquired 600,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs and is developing its own AI chip.\n\nIts Reality Labs division is driving immersive experiences with products like the Meta Quest VR headset and Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company\u2019s AI language model, Llama, is poised to enhance hardware-social media integration. Recent updates to Ray-Ban Meta glasses have boosted sales, and a renewed partnership with EssilorLuxottica signals a strong commitment to smart eyewear technology. In October, it launched features designed to help young adults discover new interests and connect with like-minded people.\n\nDriven by a robust user base, cutting-edge AI, and sophisticated advertising, the company is rapidly expanding. A commitment to innovation, including a strategic push into the metaverse, positions it for continued success. AI-powered products, such as Meta AI and Meta Smart Glasses, offer users unparalleled experiences.\n\nHere\u2019s\u00a0what\u00a0**[Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC](https://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/mar-vista-investment-partners-llc/7675/)** said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024\u00a0[**investor letter**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/should-you-invest-in-meta-platforms-meta-2-1341027/#google_vignette):\n\n> \u201cDuring the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and\u00a0**Meta Platforms, Inc.**\u00a0(NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company\u2019s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street\u2019s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta\u2019s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nOverall, META **ranks 3rd** on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the [**cheapest AI stock**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/undervalued-ai-stock-poised-for-massive-gains-10000-upside-12/).\n\n**READ NEXT:** [**$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/15-best-humanoid-robot-stocks-to-buy-according-to-morgan-stanley-1332001/) **and** [**Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/jim-cramer-says-nvidia-corp-nasdaqnvda-has-become-a-wasteland-1330875/) **.**\n\nDisclosure: None.

The WhatsApp acquisition closed at a steep $16\u00a0billion; more than $40 per user of the platform.

However, Meta\u2019s new plan to keep engagement high on its platforms could represent a major shift in AI regarding how it can be used by companies in the social media space.\n\nConnor Hayes, Meta\u2019s vice president of product for generative AI, recently revealed that the company\u2019s new range of AI products includes one that will help users create their own AI characters on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n[![NEW YORK, NY - October 27 : Elon Musk on stage before Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York, NY on Sunday, October 27, 2024.

The platform once sparked an entire generation\u2019s interest in social media, as users of many different age groups flocked to join the digital revolution. Still, in recent years, things have shifted.\n\nA recent [study](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/) from the Pew Research Center reveals that only 32% of teenagers say that they regularly use Facebook, down from the 71% that said they did in 2014. While Instagram still remains fairly popular with young users, teens have increasingly opted to use platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat over Facebook.\n\nThis presents a problem for Meta, and the company seems to see AI-generated users as the solution.\n\n[![Image of hacker attacking a computer

fundamental shift in how we interact online, he says.\n\n\u201cThese entities won\u2019t just be bots\u2014they\u2019ll be hyper-personalized, adaptive digital beings designed to engage us in ways humans can\u2019t, such as 24/7 availability, instant data recall, and perfectly tailored conversations.\u201d\n\n## Meta\u2019s growth plan poses ethical concerns\n\nIf these highly advanced bots are indeed coming, how will the social media ecosystem be impacted?\n\nVahdat also elaborated on that question, noting that \u201cAI-generated accounts could rewrite the rules of social media virality.\u201d He also sees a future in which these AI versions of digital influencers \u201cmight outcompete human influencers in scale, consistency, and engagement.\u201c\n\nAs Vahdat sees it, this trend has the power to energize struggling platforms like Facebook but could also easily be manipulated. \u201cIf these AI characters begin shaping cultural narratives, Meta will need to ensure users know when they\u2019re interacting with an algorithm rather than a person,\u201d he warns.\n\n[![Elon Musk Donald Trump Lead KL

concerns regarding the problems that Meta\u2019s AI expansion could pose. Technology attorney Star Kashman, a founding partner at [Cyber Law Firm](https://cyberlf.com/), also provided context on the broader implications of this trend. In her words:\n\n> \u201cAI users will likely prioritize pushing out content that drives engagement metrics, regardless of its emotional or psychological impact on users. An AI user is not the same as a regular user, who could see something and feel harmed and hurt by that content, ignoring it and pushing it down.\u201d\n\nShe adds that if AI users can only see statistics, it will likely \u201camplify the algorithm\u2019s tendency to promote extreme or harmful content,\u201d which she sees as already a significant problem.\n\n[![A hand pulling an investing book off of a bookshelf, overlaid with subtle graphics of stock charts](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_640/MjA5NTIwNTA5MTMyNDgyMTk4/best-investing-books.jpg)](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/best-investing-books)\n\n[**The 10 best investing books (according to stock market pros)**](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/best-investing-books)\n\n[Read More](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/best-investing-books?source_type=article_card&source_id=ci02f05719c0002623)\n\n[![A hand pulling an investing book off of a bookshelf, overlaid with subtle graphics of stock charts](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_640/MjA5NTIwNTA5MTMyNDgyMTk4/best-investing-books.jpg)](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/best-investing-books)\n\n[**The 10 best investing books (according to stock market pros)**](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/best-investing-books)\n\n[Read More](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/best-investing-books?source_type=article_card&source_id=ci02f05719c0002623)\n\n## Related news on TheStreet\n\n[![Jeff Bezos is seen talking about space.](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgyNDcwOTgzMDc0OTgwOTk1/jeff-bezos_blue-origin_3_071621.jpg)](/retail/ceo-of-popular-retailer-identifies-major-amazon-weakness \"CEO of popular retailer identifies major Amazon weakness\")\n\n[Retail, Shopping Malls, Chain Stores News & Analysis](https://www.thestreet.com/retail)\n\n[AMZN](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/AMZN) [BKS](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/BKS)\n\n[**CEO of popular retailer identifies major Amazon weakness**](/retail/ceo-of-popular-retailer-identifies-major-amazon-weakness)\n\n[By Jena Warburton](https://www.thestreet.com/author/jena-greene)\n\n6 hours ago\n\n[![An artist's rendering of the inside of a quantum computer.](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjExNzY3MTMzNTEwNTc1NjUx/quantum_computers_stocks_kl.jpg)](/investing/stocks/veteran-analyst-who-was-early-to-quantum-computing-revamps-outlook-after-stocks-get-clobbered \"Veteran analyst early to quantum computing stocks revamps outlook after stocks get clobbered\")\n\n[Stock Investing News, Analysis and Tips](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks)\n\n[NVDA](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/NVDA) [AAPL](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/AAPL) [RGTI](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/RGTI)\n\n[**Veteran analyst who was early to quantum computing revamps outlook after stocks get clobbered**](/investing/stocks/veteran-analyst-who-was-early-to-quantum-computing-revamps-outlook-after-stocks-get-clobbered)\n\n[By Rob Lenihan](https://www.thestreet.com/author/rob-lenihan)\n\n9 hours ago\n\n[![Fundstrat's Tom Lee at TheStreet investing event.](https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NjE2ODcwNzQ2MTcxMDA4/tom-lee-fundstrat.jpg)](/investing/veteran-analyst-who-forecast-2024s-rally-offers-blunt-take-on-recent-selling \"Veteran analyst who forecast 2024's rally offers blunt take on recent selling\")\n\n[Investing News, Analysis, and Tips](https://www.thestreet.com/investing)\n\n[TSLA](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/TSLA) [AAPL](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/AAPL) [NVDA](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/NVDA)\n\n[**Veteran analyst who forecast 2024's rally offers blunt take on recent selling**](/investing/veteran-analyst-who-forecast-2024s-rally-offers-blunt-take-on-recent-selling)\n\n[By Rob Lenihan](https://www.thestreet.com/author/rob-lenihan)\n\n16 hours ago\n\n[![Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025.

That\u2019s exactly what happened to me recently, when Meta (you know, the tech giant behind Facebook and Instagram) released an update that had me tossing aside my plans and jumping straight into action. It\u2019s the kind of news that demands our attention, and if you\u2019re a small business owner relying on social media, this could change everything.\n\nFor months, Meta had been quietly hinting that big changes were coming. Not in the obvious \u201chere\u2019s a press release\u201d kind of way, but with subtle suggestions that, if you were paying close attention, told a story of what was to come. And, as someone who\u2019s always keeping an eye on these things, I\u2019d been preparing my private clients for months, warning them to rethink their social media content strategies. And now, it's all unfolding, just as I suspected.\n\n### Meta Wants to Be Google (Yes, You Read That Right!)\n\nImagine this: you\u2019re searching for something online, but instead of heading straight to Google, you open up Facebook or Instagram to find your answers. That\u2019s Meta\u2019s vision, and they\u2019re already making moves to turn it into reality. They want to train you\u2014and your customers\u2014to come to them with questions, just like you would with Google.\n\nThis is HUGE for small businesses. It means your social media content isn\u2019t just about catchy captions and pretty pictures anymore. It\u2019s about being found, being discovered, and being relevant in searches, just like you\u2019d optimize your website or blog for Google.\n\n### Meta\u2019s New AI Features: What You Need to Know\n\nOvernight, Meta rolled out several features that confirm they\u2019re serious about becoming a search engine. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what they\u2019ve introduced:\n\n1. Meta AI Search: Powered by Llama and Bing (yes, Bing!), Meta now offers an AI search feature. When you ask it a question like, \u201cHow do I find a good business coach?\u201d it\u2019ll give you answers based on the content on its platform or direct you to a Bing link. Your business posts could be part of those answers!\n2. Talking AI Assistants: You can now ask Meta\u2019s AI for advice or to tell you a story, similar to Siri or Google Assistant. It\u2019s designed to get users accustomed to looking for answers within Meta\u2019s ecosystem.\n3. Creative Tools Like Canva: Meta has introduced features that allow you to edit photos, change backgrounds, and even create AI-generated selfies. This means you can now do more within Meta than ever before, making it easier to create content that stands out.\n\n### What Does This Mean for Your Business?\n\nIf you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u201cGreat, but what does this mean for me?\u201d then let\u2019s break it down. This shift means your captions, photos, and entire social media strategy need to be more intentional. Here are a few key things to consider:\n\n- Content Optimization: It\u2019s time to start thinking of your social media captions like mini-blog posts. Incorporate keywords and phrases that your audience might search for. For example, if you\u2019re a florist, instead of writing \u201cBeautiful flowers for today,\u201d you might write, \u201cFresh flowers in Melbourne: Perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, and more.\u201d This makes it more likely that your post will show up when someone searches for those terms.\n- Leverage Alt Text: Make sure you\u2019re using alt text on your images. If Meta is moving towards a search model, this will become increasingly important for helping your content be found.\n- Think Like a Search Engine: Imagine your Instagram or Facebook profile is a mini-website. How would you optimize it to be found? How can you make sure that if someone searches for your services, they land on your page?\n\n## Recommended by LinkedIn\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQF2VYe-iGrrZw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1695729933789?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=GiI90RIkG8txZdrwKZr52FbCSrh1goIw8XVAnis9GcI)\\\\\nDigital Marketing Weekly Roundup \\| Neil Patel Digital\u2026\\\\\n\\\\\nNeil Patel Digital India\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-marketing-weekly-roundup-neil-patel-india-7c)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFZKcgfgXO3Ug/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1735280411490?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ipbo-HYHoCTlruD_qJUhz_MKWFuHVRVLhC9pU7sm11Q)\\\\\nHow to Build A Successful Career in Digital Marketing\u2026\\\\\n\\\\\nUltrafly Solutions Private Limited\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n1 week ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-build-successful-career-digital-marketing-2025-despite-xa1kc)\n\n[![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHPT0oB0UJ79Q/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1729488330240?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=oEhJmaNyWAPlXba9Iy5OhbV_WIbqofg-qhf_lcJOb5o)\\\\\nINVITE: \"Clone Yourself: Create a GPT-Powered\u2026\\\\\n\\\\\nAdam Franklin\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n2 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/invite-clone-yourself-create-gpt-powered-marketing-engine-franklin-tkxxc)\n\n### Curiosity Is Key: It\u2019s Time to Get Curious!\n\nThis is the moment to embrace curiosity. Ask yourself questions like:\n\n- How can I change my social media strategy to be more search-friendly?\n- What keywords do my customers use when they\u2019re looking for what I offer?\n- How can I make sure my content is discoverable not just on Google, but now on Meta as well?\n\nThe most successful business owners I know are the ones who lean into curiosity, who constantly ask questions, and who adapt when things change. And this is one of those moments when being curious could be your greatest asset.\n\n### Take Action: Prepare for 2025 Now\n\nIn this blog, I\u2019ve just scratched the surface of what this Meta update means for us as small business owners. There\u2019s so much more to unpack, and I'll be diving into these strategies in detail in future episodes. But for now, take this as a wake-up call: your social media content can\u2019t just be about getting likes and shares anymore. It\u2019s about being found.\n\n### Join the Conversation\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this update! Join the discussion in the [Like Minded Business Owners Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LikeMindedBusinessOwners) and share your ideas, concerns, and questions about how Meta\u2019s changes will impact your business.\n\nLet\u2019s keep learning, adapting, and staying curious together.

By June of that year, Zuckerberg and friends moved operations to Silicon Valley.\n- The news feature was added in 2006 as Facebook membership is opened to anyone age 13 and older. Major companies, such as Coca-Cola, begin advertising on Facebook.\n- Facebook launched Pages for businesses and brands to establish profiles in 2007 as the site passed MySpace to become the top social media platform.\n- 2012 is a banner year as Facebook achieves a $100+ billion valuation with its highly anticipated IPO and later that year, Facebook snaps up Instagram for approximately $1 billion in cash and stock.\n- Facebook reached 1 billion users in 2013.\n- Video capabilities were expanded in 2014, and Facebook acquired messaging app WhatsApp in a $19 billion deal.\n- Facebook reaches 3 billion monthly users in 2021, including 2 billion active daily users, and changes its name of the parent company to Meta Platforms.\n\nThe Meta Ecosystem: A Digital Domain\n\nThe Meta ecosystem is now a dominant digital domain that owns four of the biggest media platforms in the world. This Meta ecosystem includes, according to The Motley Fool as of August 2024:\n\n- Facebook:\u00a0The flagship platform, with 3 billion monthly active users and \u2013 love it or hate it! -- the world\u2019s undisputed biggest social media platform.\n- Instagram:\u00a0Visual-focused social media with over 2 billion monthly active users and is the world\u2019s fourth largest social media platform.\n- WhatsApp:\u00a0End-to-end encrypted messaging app with 2 billion users. Facebook acquired it in 2014, and its reach has quadrupled since then, becoming the third largest social media platform.\n- Messenger:\u00a0Facebook's standalone messaging app which was acquired in 2011 when Beluga was bought. It\u2019s the 7th\u00a0largest social media platform with a potential reach of 979 million.\n- Threads:\u00a0A text-based conversation app integrated with Instagram. Threads was constructed to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) platform.\n- Oculus VR:\u00a0Facebook purchased this immersive VR tech company in 2014, and it is part of Meta\u2019s Reality Labs business unit.\n- Reality Labs:\u00a0Formed in 2020, Reality Labs combines VR and AR hardware and software such as Oculus, CTRL-labs, and Spark AR. Reality Labs new products include Project Aria (smart glasses), AI and the metaverse (Horizon Worlds).\n- CTRL-labs:\u00a0In 2019 Meta bought CTRL-Labs for its mind-reading wristband that utilizes neural interfaces.\n\nAll told, Meta/Facebook over the years has acquired nearly 100 companies to expand its reach to 70+ percent of the world\u2019s internet users.\n\nDominating Digital Advertising\n\nMeta's vast user base and sophisticated targeting capabilities have made it a juggernaut in the digital advertising world. In 2023, the company\u00a0[generated 98.4 percent of its revenue from advertising, amounting to $131.9 billion.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277229/facebooks-annual-revenue-and-net-income/)\n\nMeta\u2019s control of digital advertising stems from their massive user base across platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, which not only provides unprecedented reach and engagement, but also creates a rich dataset of user behaviors, interests, and connections.\n\nSophisticated targeting capabilities take advantage of this data to allow advertisers to reach very specific audiences with high precision.\n\nMeta continues to innovate its advertising offerings to provide more value to businesses:\n\n- Conversion Value Rules:\u00a0Allowing advertisers to assign different values to specific audiences or conversions. This allows campaigns to be optimized as businesses reach those audiences that matter most to them.\n- Incremental Conversions:\u00a0A new attribution setting focused on measuring the direct impact of Meta ads.\n- CRM Integration:\u00a0Plans to integrate data directly from advertisers' CRM systems for improved targeting accuracy\n\nThese advancements aim to provide more precise insights and enhanced campaign optimization for advertisers.\n\n\u201cWhen advertisers come to Meta, they want us to deliver the results that matter to them. Every business is unique in what they value most, which is why we offer different ways for them to optimize campaigns,\u201d\u00a0[explained Meta in August 2024](https://blog.adwhite.com/-temporary-slug-1b2f462d-73c7-41c8-ba89-9a051772ae28/about:blankWhen%20advertisers%20come%20to%20Meta,%20they%20want%20us%20to%20deliver%20the%20results%20that%20matter%20to%20them.%20Every%20business%20is%20unique%20in%20what%20they%20value%20most,%20which%20is%20why%20we%20offer%20different%20ways%20for%20them%20to%20optimize%20campaigns.). \u201cUnderstanding exactly what a business values allows us to bring a level of customization to each of their ad campaigns, which is integral to making sure our AI models and automation solutions continue to maximize every dollar spent.\u201d\n\nThe Organic Reach Dilemma and How to Respond\n\nWhile Meta's platforms offer unparalleled reach for paid advertising, organic reach has seen a steady decline over the years.\n\n\u201cOrganic social media reach can be one frustrating metric for brands strategizing content. You put time, research and effort into curating and posting your brand content, but then it seems like no matter what \u201calgorithm-hacking\u201d formula you follow, your posts only reach a tiny percentage of your audience,\u201d\u00a0[Forbes Councils Member Ismael EL Qudsi wrote in 2023.](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2023/04/27/are-the-days-of-organic-social-media-reach-over/)\n\nThis shift has forced businesses to adapt their strategies, often requiring a mix of paid and organic content to maintain visibility and engagement.\n\nHere are some tips for businesses navigating this meta-dominated landscape:\n\n- Diversify Your Platform Presence:\u00a0Don't put all your digital eggs in one basket. While Facebook remains dominant, ensure your business has a presence on Instagram, and consider how WhatsApp or Messenger could fit into your marketing strategy.\n- Embrace Video Content:\u00a0Video having \u201cit\u2019s moment\u201d has morphed into video is now considered the most effective way to market. With the rise of Reels on Instagram and Facebook, short-form video content has become crucial for engaging audiences across Meta's platforms.\n- Leverage Advanced Targeting\u00a0Take advantage of Meta's sophisticated targeting options to reach your ideal customers. Utilize custom audiences, lookalike audiences, and detailed targeting to maximize your ad spending efficiency.\n- Stay Agile:\u00a0Meta's platforms and algorithms are constantly evolving. Stay informed about changes and be prepared to adapt your strategies quickly.\n- Focus on Community Building:\u00a0Despite the decline in organic reach, building a strong community around your brand can still yield significant benefits. Engage with your audience consistently and meaningfully.\n- Integrate Meta Pixels: Implement\u00a0Meta pixels (JavaScript code that tracks visitor activity) on your website to track conversions, build retargeting audiences, and gain valuable insights about your customers' behavior.\n- Explore Emerging Features:\u00a0Stay ahead of the curve by experimenting with new features like Shops, Live Shopping, or AR experiences as they become available.\n\nThe Future of Meta and Digital Marketing\n\nAs Meta continues to evolve, it appears that its influence on digital marketing will only grow.\n\nWhile the company's focus on the \"metaverse\" \u2013 a collective virtual shared space \u2013 has not opened new frontiers for advertising and brand experiences on a promised level yet, history dictates that betting against Meta might be a foolish move.\n\nMeta\u2019s spot at the top of the social media mountain is not without challenges, especially with increased scrutiny over data privacy, potential antitrust regulations, and the need to balance user experience with advertising revenue.\n\nFor all we know, somewhere in the metaverse, in a digital room, the next Zuckerberg is plotting new technologies that will transform marketing two decades from now.\n\nRemember it wasn\u2019t that long ago when\u00a0[one definition of \u201cviral marketing\u201d](https://ccbjournal.com/articles/advertising-marketing-and-promotions-2004-year-review-dont-cross-line-2005)\u00a0was \u201cviral marketing strives to have consumers propagate an advertiser's message through word-of-mouth and e-mail chains, instead of using costly traditional methods.\u201d\n\nFor\u00a0now, businesses must pay close attention to the \u201cMeta takeover\u201d and figure out the best way to effectively leverage Meta\u2019s ecosystem of platforms and tools to successfully reach their audiences.\n\nNow, I need to check my email chain \u2026\n\n[![](/images/cd/adWhite24_logo.jpg)](/cdps/cditem.cfm?nid=5729)\n\n[adWhite](/cdps/cditem.cfm?nid=5729)\n\n[Visit Our Business Listing](/cdps/cditem.cfm?nid=5729) [Visit Website](http://www.adWhite.com/)\n\nComments \u2022 0\n\n![](/images/reguser/reguser_profiledefault.jpg)\n\nSmall Business Marketing 101 - from adWhite Blogs: (12)\n\n\nPrevious\n\n[![Google: That\u2019s the Way the Cookie (Doesn\u2019t!)

shadow\n\n[Article](https://www.emarketer.com/articles) by **[Daniel Konstantinovic](https://www.emarketer.com/analysts/daniel-konstantinovic)**\u00a0\u00a0\\|\u00a0\u00a0Oct 31, 2024\n\nShare\n\nTopics\n\n[Social Media Users](https://www.emarketer.com/topics/topic/social-media-users)\n\n[Social Media Usage](https://www.emarketer.com/topics/topic/social-media-usage)\n\n[Social Media Marketing](https://www.emarketer.com/topics/topic/social-media-marketing)\n\n[United States](https://www.emarketer.com/search/?query=united%20states)\n\n**The news: Meta** reported a strong Q3 with revenues beating expectations and landing just shy of 20% growth. While the gains emphasize its continued leadership in the social media market, lower-than-expected user growth could foreshadow challenges.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n\n- Revenues were $40.6 billion, up 19% year over year and above expectations of $40.29 billion.\n- Family daily active people grew 5% YoY to 3.29 billion, falling below expectations.\n- Costs and expenses grew 14% YoY, including wider losses for metaverse segment **Reality Labs**. Headcount was up 9%, bringing its total to 72,404.\n\n**Despite significant revenue gains, Meta shares were down 10% in pre-market trading**, a sign that investors are anxious about slow user growth and rising business investments.\n\nThe streak of revenue gains overlaps with a nearly two-year long cost-cutting effort that has seen the company [lay off tens of thousands of employees](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/meta-s--year-of-efficiency--shifts-permanent-strategy-layoffs--restructuring-persist?_gl=1*xuv0wu*_gcl_au*MTQ3OTU2Mjg1Mi4xNzI0NzY3MTgzLjIzOTczNjExMC4xNzMwMzEwMDQxLjE3MzAzMTAyMDQ.*_ga*MTcwOTkwNDkzNi4xNjk5Mzc1OTg1*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*MTczMDMwOTYxOS44MjkuMS4xNzMwMzEwMjIxLjM5LjAuMA..&_ga=2.28754174.372069724.1730124101-1709904936.1699375985). Meta dubbed 2023 its \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d but the effort has spilled over well into 2024; the company went through another round of layoffs earlier this month.\n\n**Why this matters:** As a leading force in social media and one half of the digital ad duopoly, Meta\u2019s earnings can indicate the health of digital advertising. Its lower-than-expected user growth falls in line with our own forecasting, which shows that time spent with media is declining from 2023 highs.\n\n- Meta will have difficulty increasing time spent on its platforms. Our [Global Media Intelligence Report](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/global-media-intelligence-report-2024) found that **time spent with all media will decline this year from 2023 peaks** (mobile time spent will remain flat), a stark reminder that there\u2019s only so much room for the metric to grow.\n- Still, Meta remains far ahead of other social media competitors. **Snap** and **[Reddit](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/reddit-q3-earnings-soar-with-ad-revenue-growth--profits-hit-record)** posted strong earnings earlier this week, but with Q3 revenues of $1.37 billion and $348.4 million, respectively, a vast gap remains between them and Meta\u2019s position.\n- [Meta is reportedly working on an AI-powered search tool](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/meta-s-ai-search-strategy-could-reshape-search-advertising-ecosystems) for **Instagram,** **Facebook**, and **WhatsApp** users to answer queries in-app rather than ceding traffic to **Google** and **Bing**, per The Information. That effort could address investor concerns about user growth.\n\n**Our take:** Meta dominates social media, and its Q3 results show the company isn\u2019t wavering. Smaller rivals are managing to make progress, but Meta\u2019s lead is nearly insurmountable.\n\n- Competition for consumers\u2019 attention is at a peak, and Meta will have to show that it can meaningfully increase revenues in the future even if user growth starts to lag.\n\nshare via email\n\n[Share via Email](mailto:?subject=Meta revenues surge in Q3, but slow user growth casts a shadow&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emarketer.com%2Fcontent%2Fmeta-revenues-surge-q3-slow-user-growth-casts-shadow \"Share via Email\")\n\n[Share via Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emarketer.com%2Fcontent%2Fmeta-revenues-surge-q3-slow-user-growth-casts-shadow \"Share via Facebook\")\n\nWant more marketing insights?\n\nSign up for EMARKETER Daily, our free newsletter.\n\nCalifornia Resident\n\nI agree to the terms of service and privacy policy.\n\nBy clicking \u201cSign Up\u201d, you agree to receive emails from EMARKETER (e.g. FYIs, partner content, webinars, and other offers) and accept our [Terms of Service](https://www.emarketer.com/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.emarketer.com/privacy/).

But in this case, Meta Platforms\u00a0 ( **[META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)**) \u00a0has a vision for its social network that isn't focused on its typical user base.\n\n**\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 [Don\u2019t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet\u2019s FREE Daily newsletter](https://www.thestreet.com/newsletters/daily?utm_source=article&utm_medium=top&utm_campaign=amazing_race_daily) \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8**\n\nThe owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp plans to implement a new business strategy that could radically transform the social media landscape.\n\nThis plan may have seemed highly futuristic only a few years ago, resembling something from a science fiction movie.\n\nIn recent years, Meta has zeroed in on metaverse technology. With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), metaverse tech has continued to grow, changing how social media users communicate, create and share content.\n\n**[Related: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/veteran-fund-manager-issues-dire-s-p-500-warning-for-2025)**\n\nHowever, Meta\u2019s leadership has stated that it is eyeing a new means of driving growth for its platforms that may change the social media landscape even more.\n\n![Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Platform CEO, at the Acquired Live event in San Francisco on Sept. 10, 2024. <em>Zuckerberg and his team have a new plan to drive growth for the social network.</em> (Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Bloomberg&sol;Getty Images](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta Platform CEO, at the Acquired Live event in San Francisco on Sept. 10, 2024. _Zuckerberg and his team have a new plan to drive growth for the social network._ (Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n## Social media's future might not be what you think\n\nMany tech companies have rushed to capitalize on the rise of AI, recognizing its power to drive growth for their platforms. However, Meta\u2019s new plan to keep engagement high on its platforms could represent a major shift in AI regarding how it can be used by companies in the social media space.\n\nConnor Hayes, Meta\u2019s vice president of product for generative AI, recently revealed that the company\u2019s new range of AI products includes one that will help users create their own AI characters on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n**[Related: Elon Musk just got the best Christmas gift he could ask for](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/elon-musk-startup-receives-cash-influx-from-some-big-tech-names)**\n\nHayes noted that Meta expects these AI users to be implemented on the platforms over time and function just like human users.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform . . . that\u2019s where we see all of this going,\u201d he states.\n\n## Social-media landscape is uncertain\n\nThis comes at a time when Meta is facing an uncertain industry landscape, particularly for Facebook. The platform once sparked an entire generation\u2019s interest in social media, as users of many different age groups flocked to join the digital revolution. Still, in recent years, things have shifted.\n\nA recent [study](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/) from the Pew Research Center reveals that only 32% of teenagers say that they regularly use Facebook, down from the 71% that said they did in 2014. While Instagram still remains fairly popular with young users, teens have increasingly opted to use platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat over Facebook.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis presents a problem for Meta, and the company seems to see AI-generated users as the solution.\n\n**[Related: Major cybersecurity attack from China exposes systematic flaws](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/major-cybersecurity-attack-from-china-exposes-systematic-flaws)**\n\nIndustry leaders like Elon Musk have expressed concern about the rise of automated social media users, often referred to simply as \u2018bots.\u2019 Now, they seem to be a cornerstone of Meta\u2019s growth plans.\n\nKaveh Vahdat, founder and CEO of generative AI-powered game creation platform RiseAngel, spoke to _TheStreet_ about Meta\u2019s AI plans.\n\n**More Tech Stocks:**\n\n- [Ongoing problem may be costing Nvidia customers](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/nvidias-chip-delays-may-be-costing-it-customers-in-key-sector)\n\n- [Tesla financial history exposes Elon Musk hypocrisy](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/surprising-source-once-helped-save-tesla-from-bankruptcy-)\n\n- [Broadcom CEO sounds alarm on crucial shift in AI-chip market](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/broadcom-ceo-sounds-alarm-on-crucial-shift-in-ai-chip-market)\n\n\n\u201cMeta\u2019s vision of AI-generated characters as \u2018digital users\u2019 signals a fundamental shift in how we interact online, he says.\n\n\u201cThese entities won\u2019t just be bots\u2014they\u2019ll be hyper-personalized, adaptive digital beings designed to engage us in ways humans can\u2019t, such as 24/7 availability, instant data recall, and perfectly tailored conversations.\u201d\n\n## Meta\u2019s growth plan poses ethical concerns\n\nIf these highly advanced bots are indeed coming, how will the social media ecosystem be impacted?\n\nVahdat also elaborated on that question, noting that \u201cAI-generated accounts could rewrite the rules of social media virality.\u201d He also sees a future in which these AI versions of digital influencers \u201cmight outcompete human influencers in scale, consistency, and engagement.\u201c\n\nAs Vahdat sees it, this trend has the power to energize struggling platforms like Facebook but could also easily be manipulated. \u201cIf these AI characters begin shaping cultural narratives, Meta will need to ensure users know when they\u2019re interacting with an algorithm rather than a person,\u201d he warns.\n\n**[Related: A year in review: the most important tech news stories of 2024](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/a-year-in-review-the-most-important-tech-news-stories-of-2024)**\n\nOther experts have raised similar concerns regarding the problems that Meta\u2019s AI expansion could pose. Technology attorney Star Kashman, a founding partner at [Cyber Law Firm](https://cyberlf.com/), also provided context on the broader implications of this trend. In her words:\n\n> \u201cAI users will likely prioritize pushing out content that drives engagement metrics, regardless of its emotional or psychological impact on users. An AI user is not the same as a regular user, who could see something and feel harmed and hurt by that content, ignoring it and pushing it down.\u201d\n\nShe adds that if AI users can only see statistics, it will likely \u201camplify the algorithm\u2019s tendency to promote extreme or harmful content,\u201d which she sees as already a significant problem.\n\n**[Related: The 10 best investing books (according to stock market pros)](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/best-investing-books)**\n\nView Comments\n\n[Terms](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Your Privacy Choices ![](https://s.yimg.com/dv/static/siteApp/img/privacy-choice-control.png)](https://guce.yahoo.com/state-controls?locale=en-US&state=CA)\n\n[CA Privacy Notice](https://guce.yahoo.com/ca-notice?locale=en-US)\n\n* * *\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying",

He also outlined plans to adopt a user-driven \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system, inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s approach on X. Zuckerberg stated Meta would overhaul its approach to content moderation by removing certain guidelines and raising the threshold for removing prohibited content. Additionally, the company plans to relocate its trust and safety operations to Texas, where, as Zuckerberg put it, \u201cthere\u2019s less concern about the bias of our teams.\u201d Zuckerberg concluded by proclaiming that, \u201cwe\u2019re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world.\u201d Meta\u2019s policy changes follow its $1 million [donation](https://www.wsj.com/tech/mark-zuckerbergs-meta-donates-1-million-to-trumps-inaugural-fund-32a999c1) to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural fund, the addition of Trump ally, [Dana White](https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-zuckerberg-board-members-dana-white-199436c62c934ebb751b564f874ad2f6), to its board and its [appointment](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/business/joel-kaplan-meta.html) of Joel Kaplan, a former Republican operative, as chief global affairs officer, signaling a deliberate strategic shift toward the incoming administration.\n\nMeta\u2019s new [policies](https://transparency.meta.com/policies) include reducing prohibitions on\u00a0 hate speech, harassment, and misinformation, effectively allowing more controversial and potentially harmful content to remain on its platforms. For instance, posts targeting marginalized groups such as transgender individuals or immigrants may no longer meet the stricter criteria for removal unless they incite direct violence. Similarly, Meta\u2019s reduced intervention in combating gender-based hate speech and disinformation campaigns disproportionately affects women and other vulnerable populations who already face systemic biases online. These changes reflect a broader trend of deregulation, aligning with Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of prioritizing free expression over community safety\u2014a shift that critics warn will deepen existing inequities and exacerbate the normalization of harmful rhetoric.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement deserves closer scrutiny than can be achieved simply through reading the transcript of his remarks. Actually watching his [speech](https://www.techpolicy.press/transcript-mark-zuckerberg-announces-major-changes-to-metas-content-moderation-policies-and-operations/) reveals a chilling display of rhetoric and intent. Three distinct, but interconnected, themes emerge from his vision: dismantling content moderation and fact-checking, distorting language, and, ultimately, destabilizing democracy.\n\n## **Dismantling Content Moderation and Fact-checking**\n\nThe consequences of dismantling content moderation are well-documented. U.S. users of X have begun to experience what an online platform looks like when it retrenches content moderation and relies on users to fact-check content. Yet, what has unfolded on X in recent months pales in comparison to what Zuckerberg has announced. The best parallel is not X today, but Facebook\u2019s [role](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/) in Myanmar from 2013- 2017, where the [absence of meaningful moderation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3905351) fueled genocide against the Rohingya.\n\nFacebook entered Myanmar against the backdrop of a society emerging from three decades of dictatorship, where there was little tradition of a free press, and where persecution of the minority Muslim population, the Rohingya, was endemic. Failing to invest in local language competency, Facebook launched (as it has done in [other](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/17/1142873282/facebook-meta-lawsuit-ethiopia-kenya-abrham-amare) Majority World countries) without anything approaching meaningful content moderation systems in place. The result, predictably enough, was online incitement to genocide against the Rohingya. Facebook had been relying on its users in Myanmar to flag problematic content. As I wrote in a 2020 [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3426544) recounting the period:\n\n> \u201cSuch a flagging system operates on the assumption that offensive content is created and tolerated by only a minority of an online community\u2026 Unfortunately, persecution of the Rohingya is tolerated across all parts of Burmese society. In other words, expecting Burmese users to alert Facebook to incitement against the Rohingya in Myanmar would be like relying on the majority Hutu population to call out incitement against the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda.\u201d\n\nToday, the example is revealing for two reasons. First, outsourcing platform governance to users is highly problematic. In Myanmar, the platform was relying on users to flag hateful content. Moving forward, Meta is relying on users to flag false content. But in both cases, the structure of the underlying problem remains: The flagging system reproduces whatever norms exist in a community of users. To Zuckerberg and Musk (and, presumably, President-elect Trump) this is a feature. For any marginalized group in a society, it is a bug. If most users on Meta believe that a Black Lives Matter protest is the work of Antifa, few will flag posts asserting those lies as false content.\n\nThe second point to absorb from the Myanmar example is that online and offline spaces are co-constitutive. One direction of that relationship is already well appreciated; a harmful online situation often does migrate to offline contexts. Less acknowledged is the degree to which offline contexts simultaneously impact online activity, such that the relationship between online and offline is effectively a giant looping mechanism. This matters in the United States at this moment, because changes in content moderation policies online are playing out against an offline context that is increasingly hostile to marginalized communities.\n\n## **Distorting Language**\n\nA close bedfellow of dismantling fact-checking is Zuckerberg\u2019s turn towards distorting language and even meaning itself. In his speech, he repeatedly and consistently replaces the term \u201ccontent moderation\u201d with the word \u201ccensorship.\u201d (See, e.g. \u201cThe problem is that the filters make mistakes, and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn\u2019t. So, by dialing them back, we\u2019re going to dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms.\u201d)\n\nContent moderation, in the social media context, refers to the (automated or human) process of reviewing content to ascertain if it aligns with an existing set of policy standards set by the social media company and, if it doesn\u2019t, to remove the content. It is generally understood as an imperfect process developed to stop online platforms turning into cesspools of vile content reflecting the worst parts of human societies. Censorship refers to the suppression of speech that, when done unlawfully by the government, can violate the U.S. Constitution, or international human rights law.\n\nTechnically, both content moderation and censorship can do the same thing \u2013 shutter speech. But, just like two different instruments playing the same note have a different\u00a0 quality, so too, the term content moderation has a different quality than the word censorship. Replacing \u201ccontent moderation\u201d with \u201ccensorship\u201d degrades our understanding of both terms.\n\n## **Destabilizing Democracy**\n\nThe erosion of content moderation and the distortion of language are not just theoretical concerns; they strike at the heart of democratic governance. Access to accurate, reliable information is a cornerstone of democracy. It enables the public to hold leaders accountable and to make informed decisions. This is why a free press has always been an indispensable requirement of sustaining a system of democratic governance. Unless the public has access to accurate information about what its representatives are doing, and the impact those decisions are having on the society they live in, then governmental accountability becomes impossible even if free and fair elections continue to be held.\n\nOver the past decade, the public\u2019s reliance on online platforms for information has grown exponentially. However, the infrastructure enabling this access has increasingly consolidated in the hands of a few ultra-wealthy individuals, raising serious [concerns](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691241173/the-tech-coup?srsltid=AfmBOorOF_6acY0UkHeMquznQ3bQeUnuxRePbTeUyKmNQ0rPSQaQPBMj) about accountability and democratic resilience. This development has not gone unnoticed, and many actors have worked hard to develop systems of accountability to mitigate the risks inherent in this structure. (Others, like [Ethan Zuckerman](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/the-case-for-digital-public-infrastructure),\u00a0 argued presciently for the need to develop entirely different structures altogether). Yet, by and large, Big Tech has been effective in shaping the discourse in favor of accountability mechanisms that have been as much about reputation management as anything else.\n\nThe business and human rights framework, developed in response to the reality that international human rights law was established to hold states, not corporations, responsible for human rights violations has helped improve corporate behavior in many spheres, including on social media platforms. But it is inherently limited by its non-binding nature and, in the hands of sophisticated Big Tech players, has been deployed cynically in the cases where it has been needed the most.\n\nAfter facing widespread condemnation in the Western media over the way its platform enabled incitement to genocide in Myanmar, Meta commissioned a [human rights impact assessment](https://www.bsr.org/en/blog/facebook-in-myanmar-human-rights-impact-assessment), carefully framed to understand the \u201cmistakes\u201d and \u201cshortcomings\u201d of its actions in Myanmar but laser focused on a \u201cforward-looking analysis.\u201d For years, this became the [playbook](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/business/mark-zuckerberg-meta-free-speech.html) for responding to any and all criticism: Apologize for \u201cmistakes\u201d and promise to do better going forward.\n\nCommunities harmed by social media have long recognized that Meta\u2019s approach to accountability is largely performative\u2014a public relations exercise contingent on the C-suite\u2019s assessment of whether such actions will mitigate reputational damage that could affect profitability. Yesterday\u2019s announcement gave a broader segment of the American public the opportunity to come to this realization as well. Fact-checking and content moderation were policies Zuckerberg championed when the political climate made the reputational\u2014and financial\u2014costs of inaction greater than the benefits. With the Trump administration about to return to power, that calculus has now shifted. The lesson is that users everywhere have become reliant on an information ecosystem over which we have almost no control, and is structured to avoid democratic accountability.\n\n###### _Image: The logos of applications, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and facebook belonging to the company Meta are displayed on the screen of an iPhone in front of a Meta logo on February 03, 2022 in Paris, France.

It has rolled out [AI chatbots](https://siliconangle.com/2024/10/28/meta-reportedly-developing-custom-search-engine-meta-ai-chatbot/) in the Messenger app, and in July it launched AI character creation tools that have already been used to create \u201chundreds of thousands of characters,\u201d according to Connor Hayes, the company\u2019s vice president of product for generative AI.\n\nThe vast majority of these AI-created characters remain private for now, but Meta anticipates they will become widespread throughout its platforms in the next few years.\n\n\u201cWe expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,\u201d Hayes told the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/91183cbb-50f9-464a-9d2e-96063825bfcf?countryCode=UKR) in an interview today. \u201cThey\u2019ll have bios and profile pictures and they\u2019ll be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform. That\u2019s where we see all of this going.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hayes, investment in AI will continue to be a priority for Meta over the next two years, as it strives to make its platforms \u201cmore entertaining and engaging\u201d for users. On Facebook, users already have access to AI tools for editing photos and creating AI assistants that can be used to respond to fans\u2019 messages.\n\nThe Financial Times article added that Meta is also planning to launch a new text-to-video tool for content creators, allowing users to insert themselves into [AI-generated videos](https://siliconangle.com/2024/12/19/instagram-add-video-editing-features-powered-metas-movie-gen-ai-model/).\n\nA spokesperson for Meta told [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/meta-invest-ai-generated-characters-profiles-drive-up-engagement) that the tool will enable people to create video characters that are \u201cAIs based on your interests.\u201d They\u2019re designed both to entertain and to provide support, so users might create AI characters that can teach others how to cook, share advice on fashion, provide tips for applying cosmetics or more.\n\n### What could go wrong?\n\nAlthough Meta does clearly label all AI-generated content on its platforms, critics say there are justifiable reasons to be alarmed about the proliferation of largely unsupervised AI users and AI-generated content on social media sites.\n\nSuch concerns include the risk of political manipulation and platforms being flooded with low-quality content, but there is also potential for more serious harm. One mother recently [filed a lawsuit](https://siliconangle.com/2024/12/10/character-ai-sued-slew-harmful-chatbot-messages-sent-children/) against the AI company Character Technologies Inc., alleging that one of its chatbots encouraged her 14-year-old son to commit suicide.\n\n\u201cWithout robust safeguards, platforms risk amplifying false narratives through these AI-driven accounts,\u201d Meta\u2019s former head of creator innovations Becky Owen told the Financial Times.\n\nOwen also warned of the risk of low-quality content diluting the brand of social media platforms. \u201cUnlike human creators, these AI personas don\u2019t have lived experiences, emotions or the same capacity for relatability,\u201d she said.\n\nHolger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE that there are obvious risks to using AI to try and engage users with its social media platforms, but he thinks it might have a positive impact in terms of retaining users.\n\n\u201cMeta wants to keep users on its Facebook and Instagram platforms and it\u2019s struggling to do this, so it\u2019s looking to see if AI can help,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cIt\u2019s early days for engagement courtesy of AI characters and they may not get it right from the start, but ultimately it\u2019s an idea that has some promise.\u201d\n\nDespite the risks, Meta appears to be determined to press ahead with its plans to swamp social media with AI, if only because it needs to see a return on the billions of dollars it has invested in the technology so far.\n\nIn April, Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said it may be several years before the company sees any payoff.\n\n\u201cHistorically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us and the initial signs are quite positive here, too,\u201d Zuckerberg said during an [earnings call](https://siliconangle.com/2024/04/24/meta-delivers-strong-earnings-results-weak-guidance-causes-investors-bail/) with analysts. \u201cBuilding the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we\u2019ve added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years.\u201d\n\n##### Image: SiliconANGLE/Microsoft Designer\n\n* * *\n\n# A message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\n\n### Your vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\n\n### One click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\n\n### [Join our community on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu3Ri8DI1RQLdVtU12uIp1Q?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n### Join the community that includes more than 15,000 \\#CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n**\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

Bravery](https://www.emarketer.com/content/how-cmos-balance-brand-integrity-bravery)\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\n\nDecember, 2024\n\n\n**The news:** Social media platforms are loosening content rules as attitudes toward moderation in major markets begin to diverge.\n\n- **Meta** CEO **Mark Zuckerberg** announced this week that it would end fact-checking on its platforms, instead opting for an **X** (formerly Twitter)-style **Community Notes** feature. However, the company will continue to seek and take down certain prohibited content related to terrorism or child exploitation, Zuckerberg said.\n- Meta, **YouTube**, and others [loosened restrictions on fact-checking and political misinformation](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/what-youtube-s-policy-changes-could-mean-2024-election-cycle-political-ad-spending?_gl=1*1v591pm*_ga*MjA5NTYxMjYyMi4xNjgzNzQyNTMz*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*MTY4OTE4OTkzNy45NC4xLjE2ODkxOTEwMzMuMC4wLjA.) in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.\n- A recent transparency report revealed that **TikTok** [employs 6,000 content moderators in Europe](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/tiktok-transparency-report-reveals-its-eu-content-moderation-efforts?_gl=1*8f4hgs*_gcl_au*NTQ3ODk3MTA1LjE3MzUyMzE5MzkuMTExMDY2ODAwMS4xNzM2MzY3Mjk2LjE3MzYzNjk5ODc.*_ga*MTEwMDIwOTUzMy4xNzM1MjMxOTM4*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*MTczNjM2NDcxMS4yMC4xLjE3MzYzNjk5OTguNTAuMC4xNTU2MzU5NDU5). However, the company also recently [laid off hundreds of moderation employees](https://content-na1.emarketer.com/tiktok-lays-off-hundredscontent-moderators-leans-on-ai) in Malaysia following a regulatory rule change.\n\n**Changes at home:** The incoming **Trump** administration in the US has caused major tech and social media companies to adjust their policies in response to the president-elect and Republican legislators, who have long criticized social platforms for perceived censorship of conservative speech.\n\n- The president-elect threatened Zuckerberg with prison time before his November general election victory, and the Meta CEO met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in late November. In December, Meta donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. X CEO **Elon Musk** has similarly carved out a place at Trump\u2019s side.\n\n**Across the pond:** In the EU, however, regulator scrutiny is forcing companies into stricter compliance on moderation.\n\n- One day after Meta announced its change, the European Commission said it is trying to wrap up an investigation into X\u2019s content moderation policies, per Bloomberg.\n- Meta\u2019s changes will first roll out in the US but could extend to other markets. Still, regulatory pressure in the EU has caused Meta, **Google**, and others to acquiesce\u2014Meta recently floated the possibility of using **eBay**\u2019s ad solutions to meet EU antitrust demands\u2014meaning the policy could be modified for stricter markets.\n\n**Our take:** Rolling back content moderation efforts kills two birds with one stone, appeasing conservative regulators and potentially aiding Meta\u2019s business interests while allowing the company to reduce costs. But the question for advertisers is whether these changes will affect brand safety.\n\nMeta offers a slew of brand safety tools that allow brands to prevent themselves from appearing alongside certain topics, insulating them somewhat from the change. The company\u2019s enormous reach means that even advertisers with brand safety concerns likely won\u2019t stop spending.\n\n[![Media Types That Will Present the Most Challenges for Brands Safety in the Next 12 Months According to US Marketing Professionals, Sep 2024 (% of respondents)](https://www.emarketer.com/content/storage/b37c84d8fe8b41eeb925567bf2b983da/288405)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20version=%221.0%22%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%0A%20width=%22470%22%20height=%22439%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20470%20439%22%0A%20preserveAspectRatio=%22xMidYMid%20meet%22%3E%0A%20%20%3Cg%20transform=%22translate(0.000000,470)%20scale(0.100000,-0.100000)%22%0A%20%20fill=%22%23000000%22%20stroke=%22none%22%3E%0A%20%20%3C/g%3E%0A%3C/svg%3E%0A)](/api/RedirectAsset?a=chart&r=295703)\n\nE-Mail ChartDownload\n\n_This article is part of EMARKETER\u2019s client-only subscription Briefings\u2014daily newsletters authored by industry analysts who are experts in marketing, advertising, media, and tech trends.

The American multinational technology conglomerate, formerly called Facebook, Inc., owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp. What\u2019s more it also has its hands in [virtual reality](https://www.techdogs.com/td-articles/curtain-raisers/an-introductory-guide-to-virtual-reality) and [augmented reality](https://www.techdogs.com/td-articles/curtain-raisers/augmented-reality-behind-the-scenes-of-digital-magic) hardware, geotagging and much more.\n\nNaturally, Meta has been at the center of various digital transformations and now it has unveiled a groundbreaking vision to redefine social media. Using its recently revealed AI portfolio, including [AI image generators,](https://www.techdogs.com/td-articles/trending-stories/how-to-use-meta-ai-for-image-generation) AI Characters and other [generative A](https://www.techdogs.com/td-articles/curtain-raisers/all-about-generative-artificial-intelligence) [I](https://www.techdogs.com/td-articles/curtain-raisers/all-about-generative-artificial-intelligence) tools, Meta aims to push AI into everyday social media interactions.\n\nSo, what does Meta have planned for social media\u2019s AI-powered future?\n\nLet\u2019s explore!\n\n## What Is Meta\u2019s New Vision For Social Media?\n\n![TechDogs-\"What Is Meta\u2019s New Vision For Social Media?\"-\"Create An AI Character\u2019 Interface Showcasing Customizable AI Profiles Like Fellow Fan For Learning And Connection\"](https://imagedelivery.net/PpcJzY_VhkINz0DBze2whQ/39fa656d-580d-4660-b30a-f60806662a00/public)\n\n[Source](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/create-your-own-custom-ai-with-ai-studio/)\n\nSocial media giant Meta is planning to fill its platforms with Ai-generated characters in the next few years to boost engagement. Meta is currently looking to leverage the fast-developing AI technology to create better experiences for its 3 billion users on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nMeta\u2019s Vice President of Product for Generative AI, Connor Hayes, said this vision of AI characters has become integral to social networks, saying, \u201c\u201cWe expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do.\u201d\n\nThese AI characters will feature profiles, bios and the capability to generate and share content, mimicking human behaviors on the platform. Hayes also stated that this is a priority for the business over the next two years as it aims to make its platforms \u201cmore entertaining and engaging.\u201d\n\nThe initiative is part of Meta\u2019s broader strategy to reshape how users interact online, blending human and AI presences seamlessly across its ecosystem. So, how does it plan to doing that?\n\n## What Is Meta\u2019s Current Progress For AI Users On Social Media?\n\nIn July 2024, Meta [launched](https://www.techdogs.com/tech-news/td-newsdesk/metas-new-ai-studio-to-let-users-create-custom-ai) AI Studio, a tool that would allow users to create AI characters for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other web-based apps. Powered by Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 model, AI Studio allows custom AI personas with unique knowledge bases and personalities that can talk directly with humans, respond to comments and much more.\n\nTo date, thousands of AI characters have been created and Meta now plans to expand AI Studio beyond the United States. By integrating these AI characters into its platform experiences over the next two years, Meta has already kickstarted its vision of the new social media landscape.\n\nThe company already announced plans to introduce AI-powered tools for follower interactions, photo editing and text-to-video generation, expected to launch in 2025. Yet, this new approach with AI characters will allow for auto-replies, responding to questions from followers and creating short video clips.\n\nMeta believes that AI characters will bring about new forms of entertainment and increase participation on social platforms.\n\n## What Challenges Is Meta Facing?\n\nWhile Meta has made significant headway, experts warn of possible risks, such as the spread of false information through the content made by AI. In fact, Meta\u2019s initial concept was to have celebrities create AI avatars of themselves but was worried about AI versions of celebrities saying problematic things.\n\nMoreover, Meta is not alone in its push to bring AI characters into social media interactions.\n\nSnapchat's generative AI tools allow users to make 3D characters for augmented reality experiences, aimed at keeping followers more interested and engaged. Even ByteDance-owned TikTok introduced \"Symphony,\" a set of AI tools for creating AI-generated avatars, videos and translations.\n\nBecky Owen, global chief marketing and innovation officer at creative agency Billion Dollar Boy and former head of Meta\u2019s creator innovations team, said, \u201cWithout robust safeguards, platforms risk amplifying false narratives through these AI-driven accounts.\u201d\n\nMeta has clearly thought this through and will label all AI-generated content across its platforms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe line between human and AI-generated content is getting blurry and this latest move by social media giant Meta to deploy AI accounts will compound the issue. While AI characters could be a new creative format for entertainment, there is always a risk of it spreading low-quality, uninformed content, eroding confidence among users.\n\nWhile improvements in AI have changed how we connect with technology, it is all set to revamp how we interact on social media with Meta\u2019s new vision.\n\nDo you think AI-generated characters will revolutionize engagement on Meta\u2019s platforms? Will Meta be able to control the spread of AI-generated content?\n\nLet us know in the comments below!\n\nFirst published on Mon, Dec 30, 2024\n\nEnjoyed what you read?

With that in mind, we\u2019ve invested $5.5 billion in our privacy program since 2019, and have grown the teams focused on privacy to more than 3,000 people. In honor of Data Privacy Day, we\u2019re looking at some areas that have benefited from this investment.\n\n![An infographic explaining that $5.5BN has been invested in Meta&#039;s privacy program since 2019.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01_Privacy-by-numbers_Carousel-1-2.jpg?fit=960%2C836)\n\n![An infographic discussing 3,000 people focused primarily on privacy in 2023.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01_Privacy-by-numbers_Carousel-2.jpg?fit=960%2C836)\n\n![An infographic explaining an average of 1,200 products, features and data practices reviewed per month to assess and mitigate privacy risks.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01_Privacy-by-numbers_Carousel-3.jpg?fit=960%2C836)\n\n## Sharing Our Privacy Progress\n\nWe\u2019ve refreshed our [Privacy Progress Update](https://about.meta.com/actions/protecting-privacy-and-security/privacy-progress/?utm_source=about.facebook.com&utm_medium=redirect&locale=en_US&draft=1174090353039893), which highlights the work we\u2019ve done to honor people\u2019s privacy. This includes updating elements of our privacy program like our regulatory readiness process, continuing to strengthen our governance and compliance functions, and leveraging our core technology expertise to address privacy at scale.\n\nOne example of this work is privacy-aware infrastructure (PAI), which enables engineers to more easily address privacy requirements as they build products. PAI will increasingly allow us to automate and embed best-in-class privacy practices, reduce our reliance on manual processes and make it easier to explain and verify how we use data.\n\nAnother example is our Privacy Review process, which now reviews an average of 1,200 products, features and data practices per month across the company before they launch to assess and mitigate privacy risks.\n\n## Building Privacy-First Products\n\nWe launched [default end-to-end encryption](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/) for personal messages and calls on Messenger and Facebook. Engineers, cryptographers, designers, policy experts and product managers worked tirelessly to rebuild Messenger from the ground up, and introduced new privacy, safety and control features along the way. The content of your messages and calls in an end-to-end encrypted conversation is protected from the moment it leaves your device to the moment it reaches the receiver\u2019s device. Nobody during this delivery, including Meta, can see or listen to what\u2019s sent or said in your calls or messages.\n\nAnother important area of investment relates to ads transparency. When you see an ad, we want you to understand why. That\u2019s why we rolled out an updated version of [Why Am I Seeing This Ad](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/increasing-our-ads-transparency/) for Facebook and Instagram Feed. This provides more transparency about how your activity \u2013 both on and off our platforms \u2013 may inform the machine learning models we use to shape and deliver ads. We\u2019ve also redesigned [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053), so people can more easily manage the ads they see.\n\nOur privacy investments were also critical as we developed next-gen hardware products like [Quest 3](https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/381574279_3192353181067107_3576232212250877955_n.pdf?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=v3yh_W14cyAAX-Xc-vD&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AfD6s5YhQmhH1ZlE0dK5WvKbSTGE70L41Hg1lsK0JeYUlQ&oe=65AF4794) and [Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses,](https://about.meta.com/ray-ban-stories-privacy/) the latter of which launched with an LED light that prevents the start of a recording session when covered. They were equally important as we launched Llama 2 \u2013 our open source large language model \u2013 with people\u2019s privacy expectations in mind. And they were core to the launch of Threads, built from day one under the guidance of our increasingly efficient privacy program.\n\n## Developing Educational Tools\n\nOver the years, we\u2019ve rolled out a number of educational tools to give people more clarity into how their data is used and their options to manage it. [Privacy Center](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/center/), which first launched in 2022, now has 11 modules, with recent ones focusing on hot topics like [generative AI](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/generative-ai/). And like prior years, we\u2019ll acknowledge Data Privacy Day by encouraging people on Facebook to take a Privacy Checkup and review important privacy and security settings.\n\nThis $5.5 billion investment, while significant, is just the beginning. Meta is a different company than it was four years ago. As the company continues to evolve,\u00a0 we\u2019ll continue to address hard questions about how to do privacy right. Both now and in the future, we\u2019ll remain committed to working with experts, policymakers and regulators to strengthen our practices and design and improve our products responsibly.\n\n* * *\n\nCategories\n\n:\n\n[Data and Privacy](https://about.fb.com/news/category/data-and-privacy/ )[Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technologies/meta/ )[Public Policy](https://about.fb.com/news/category/public-policy/ )\n\nTags:\n\n[Privacy Matters](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/privacy-matters/)\n\n* * *\n\n## Related News\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

        "markdown": "# Meta\u2019s New AI Policy: A Legal Storm Brewing?\n\n[June 14, 2024](https://www.preiskel.com/2024/06/14/ \"4:57 pm\") [By Preiskel & Co](https://www.preiskel.com/author/maltin-pr/ \"View all posts by Preiskel & Co\")\n\nMeta has recently updated its privacy policy to include the use of information shared on its platforms, such as posts, photos, and captions, for AI training. This extends to personal information from publicly available and licensed sources. The new privacy policy will come into effect on the 26th of June.\n\nPrivacy advocacy group Noyb has filed complaints with Data Protection Authorities in 11 European countries, including France, Italy, Ireland, Norway, and Spain, urging regulators to commence urgent GDPR proceedings to prevent the implementation of this policy. Noyb argues that Meta intends to use both public and private user data, encompassing years of personal posts and images, for unspecified future AI technology, without providing users with clear information about the purpose of this data processing.\n\nMeta has assured that private chats with friends and family will not be used for AI training, a detail Noyb noted as the sole exception. Noyb founder Max Schrems has criticised Meta\u2019s stance, claiming it defies GDPR compliance by asserting the right to use any data from any source for any purpose through AI technology. Schrems emphasised that the European Court of Justice has previously ruled that Meta cannot override users\u2019 data protection rights for advertising purposes, suggesting that Meta is disregarding these legal judgments.\n\n**Opt-Out Mechanism**\n\nA key aspect of Meta\u2019s new privacy policy is the opt-out mechanism provided for users who do not wish their data to be used for AI training. Noyb has criticised this process, arguing that it is unnecessarily complex and serves as a deterrent. The requirement for users to provide a reason for their objection is seen as a barrier to exercising their data protection rights. Moreover, Noyb has highlighted that the opt-out option does not address the use of personal data that has already been processed by Meta\u2019s AI systems, potentially violating the GDPR\u2019s right to be forgotten.\n\nFurthermore, the potential for users to claim that their right to be forgotten has been breached adds another layer of legal exposure. To mitigate these risks, a more transparent and user-friendly opt-out process should be afforded to end users, ensuring it fully complies with GDPR standards. To meet the regulatory requirements, Meta should proactively communicate with their customers about their data rights and the steps taken to protect their personal information.\n\n**Implications for UK Organisations**\n\nIf Meta\u2019s policy is deemed non-compliant with GDPR, UK companies using Meta\u2019s platforms might face legal and reputational risks. Organisations should accordingly monitor the outcomes of these proceedings closely, as they may need to reassess their data protection strategies and policies. Additionally, they may face increased scrutiny from regulators, leading to potential investigations and enforcement actions. Organisations might also face loss of customer trust, as users become more aware and concerned about their data privacy. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial for UK businesses to ensure their data protection practices align with GDPR requirements.\n\nFind out more about Nyob\u2019s complaints [here](https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-urges-11-dpas-immediately-stop-metas-abuse-personal-data-ai).\n\nPlease contact\u00a0[Jose Saras](https://www.preiskel.com/people/jose-saras/)\u00a0and\u00a0[Xavier Prida](https://www.preiskel.com/people/xavier-prida/)\u00a0for detailed advice on how AI and personal data regulations apply to your organisation.\n\nThe material in this article is only for general review of the topics covered and does not constitute legal advice.

Once this loads, you're going to click 'right to object' \u2026 and you're going to be taken to a form that you're going to fill out and explain why you don't want your data taken.\"\n\n\"Having to justify why I don't want my privacy to be violated is crazy,\" one TikTok user commented.\n\nSkeptical posts about the opt-out feature also were shared on\u00a0[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1d5h15h/how_to_optout_of_meta_using_your_data_for_ai/), [X](https://x.com/Tantacrul/status/1794863603964891567)\u00a0and\u00a0[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/C74D9_tsSEe/?hl=en). \"Meta is apparently trying to make opting out of their AI training impossible.

That's because while the feature was available to Meta's European Region and United Kingdom customers, it wasn't available to users in the United States.\n\n\"Facebook and Instagram users in the UK and Europe recently received a notification or email about how their information will be used for AI from 26 June,\" the BBC\u00a0[reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw99n3qjeyjo). In fact, in May 2024, Meta [stated](https://about.fb.com/news/h/bringing-generative-ai-experiences-to-people-in-europe/), \"This year we plan to expand AI at Meta \u2013 our collection of generative AI features and experiences along with the models that power them \u2013 to more people across the globe, including Europe.\" U.S. users received no such notification.\n\nA June 7\u00a0[article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/technology/meta-ai-scraping-policy.html)\u00a0in The New York Times said: \"The announcement to European users sparked some backlash on Reddit, Tiktok and Twitter, including in the U.S., where Meta was not required to notify users \u2014 and therefore users may not have realized \u2014 that it had been training its A.I. with their public posts.\" The Times highlighted that users in the United States, where online privacy regulations are less strict than in Europe,\u00a0had already had their public posts used by for AI training by Meta. \"It is not clear when Meta began to scrape data from users based in the U.S,\" the article said.\n\nTo confirm these reports firsthand, we began by following the opt-out steps outlined in the viral [TikTok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@flick.social/video/7376662539746250016) on a device located in Europe.

The European Center for Digital Rights ( [noyb](https://noyb.eu/en)), a nonprofit organization based in Austria that [focuses](https://apnews.com/general-news-18a537b8b234445fa4eab2633a4a516d) on enforcing digital rights and privacy laws, [said](https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-urges-11-dpas-immediately-stop-metas-abuse-personal-data-ai)\u00a0it \"filed complaints in 11 European countries, asking the authorities to launch an urgency procedure to stop this change immediately, before it comes into force on 26 June 2024.\"\n\nSimilarly to the feedback from social media users, the watchdog argued that the opt-out procedure was overly complicated and time-consuming. \"While in theory an opt-out could be implemented in such way that it requires only one click (like the 'unsubscribe' button in newsletters), Meta makes it extremely complicated to object, even requiring personal reasons,\" the group said.\u00a0\"Shifting the responsibility to the user is completely absurd. The law requires Meta to get opt-in consent, not to provide a hidden and misleading opt-out form,\" said Max Schrems, [honorary chairman](https://noyb.eu/en/our-team-members-and-partners)\u00a0and founder of noyb said.\n\n\"The European Court of Justice has already made it clear that Meta has no 'legitimate interest' to override users' right to data protection when it comes to advertising,\" Schrems said. \"Yet the company is trying to use the same arguments for the training of undefined 'AI technology'. It seems that Meta is once again blatantly ignoring the judgements of the CJEU.\" He also expressed concerns over the possibly broad extent to which the data gathered by Meta could be used:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n> Meta is basically saying that it can use \"any data from any source for any purpose and make it available to anyone in the world,\" as long as it's done via \"AI technology.\" This is clearly the opposite of GDPR compliance. \"AI technology\" is an extremely broad term. Much like \"using your data in databases,\" it has no real legal limit. Meta doesn't say what it will use the data for, so it could either be a simple chatbot, extremely aggressive personalised advertising or even a killer drone. Meta also says that user data can be made available to any \"third party\" - which means anyone in the world.\n\nMeta [said](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/building-ai-technology-for-europeans-in-a-transparent-and-responsible-way/)\u00a0in a June 2024 news release that it was honoring all objections from European users.\n\n\"If an objection form is submitted before Llama training begins, then that person's data won't be used to train those models, either in the current training round or in the future,\" it said. \"We're not using people's private messages with friends and family to train our AI systems, nor do we use content from accounts of Europeans under age 18,\" it continued, adding that it wasn't \"using content that people have chosen to make public to build our foundational AI model that we release openly.\"\n\n## Update\n\nOn June 14, 2024, Meta updated its press release with the title \"Building AI Technology for Europeans in a Transparent and Responsible Way,\" informing it was\u00a0[pausing](https://reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/meta-will-not-launch-meta-ai-europe-now-2024-06-14/)\u00a0the launch of its AI models:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n> _**Update on June 14, 2024 at 7:30am PT:**_\n>\n> We're disappointed by the request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), our lead regulator, on behalf of the European DPAs, to delay training our large language models (LLMs) using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram\u00a0 \u2014 particularly since we incorporated regulatory feedback and the European DPAs have been informed since March. This is a step backwards for European innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Europe.\n>\n> We remain highly confident that our approach complies with European laws and regulations. AI training is not unique to our services, and we're more transparent than many of our industry counterparts.\n>\n> We are committed to bringing Meta AI, along with the models that power it, to more people around the world, including in Europe. But, put simply, without including local information we'd only be able to offer people a second-rate experience. This means we aren't able to launch Meta AI in Europe at the moment.\n>\n> We will continue to work collaboratively with the DPC so that people in Europe have access to \u2013 and are properly served by \u2013 the same level of AI innovation as the rest of the world.\n>\n> This delay will also enable us to address specific requests we have received from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), our UK regulator, ahead of starting the training.\n\n\"In response to 11 noyb complaints, the DPC has announced (late Friday afternoon) that Meta has committed to the DPC that it will not process EU/EEA user data for undefined 'artificial intelligence techniques'. Previously, Meta had argued that it had a 'legitimate interest' in doing so,\" noyb [reported](https://noyb.eu/en/preliminary-noyb-win-meta-stops-ai-plans-eu), adding that \"There is so far no further context or information as to what this engagement looked like, or why the DPC changed its mind.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThis isn't the first time we've investigated a Meta-related rumor. For example, in May 2024, we [debunked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/facebook-account-notice-photos/) a false rumor claiming that posting a legal notice on your Facebook wall would protect you from having all your posts and photos made public. We have also [looked at](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/facebook-799-charge-coming/) a claim that\u00a0Facebook announced plans to begin charging users $7.99 per month to access the website.\n\n#### Sources\n\n\"Building AI Technology for Europeans in a Transparent and Responsible Way.\" _Meta_, 10 June 2024, https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/building-ai-technology-for-europeans-in-a-transparent-and-responsible-way/.\n\nChee, Foo Yun, and Foo Yun Chee. \"Meta Faces Call in EU Not to Use Personal Data for AI Models.\" _Reuters_, 6 June 2024. _www.reuters.com_, https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-gets-11-eu-complaints-over-use-personal-data-train-ai-models-2024-06-06/.\n\n_Facebook_. https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policies/uso/.

        "markdown": "# Meta\u2019s Privacy Policies: Designed Badly, by Design?\n\nJustin Sherman / Nov 25, 2024\n\n![ ](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/3tzzh18d/production/dd929920022802ec95c5ca6320d37fa55baaa966-1200x675.png)\n\n[Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/illustration-man-lost-complex-labyrinth-surreal-2185179045)\n\nAnyone who\u2019s ever used any digital service knows that privacy policies aren\u2019t exactly picture books. Usually, they\u2019re incredibly difficult to read. Research, [polling](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/), [reporting](https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2023/08/03/how-to-quickly-get-to-the-important-truth-inside-any-privacy-policy), and personal experiences [abound](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) on why privacy policies are so [bad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/31/abolish-privacy-policies/) these days: [they are too long](https://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/readingPolicyCost-authorDraft.pdf), [use legalistic and inaccessible terminology](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html), [are presented as take-it-or-leave-it](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/ff3341dc-dd6f-5fdf-920c-245521837c05/content), and [much more](https://kb.osu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/d6692cd5-a08e-534e-9350-735fb279bce4/content). None of this is new information (although, it\u2019s all still a serious and widespread problem).\n\nBut less attention is often paid to how privacy policies themselves are _displayed._ As someone who has spent a substantial amount of time reviewing these policies across countless companies and platforms, in my work researching commercial data practices, I\u2019ve come to regard one company as perhaps the worst of the lot in how it visually presents its policies: Meta. Regulators and lawmakers should take note.\n\n## **How did it get this way?**\n\nThe 20-year-old, US-based multinational conglomerate founded by Mark Zuckerberg has [over three billion](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results-Initiates-Quarterly-Dividend/default.aspx) daily active users worldwide and operates products and services ranging from Facebook and Instagram to WhatsApp, Oculus, and AI models such as Llama. Yet, understanding what the company is collecting, inferring, and purchasing, let alone doing with individuals\u2019 data, is made even more challenging by the way Meta incomprehensibly lays out its privacy policy language.\n\nIt is, to say the least, a test to think of any company besides Meta that puts so much effort into breaking up its privacy policies into probably hundreds of indigestible pieces, scattered across numerous websites and pages, with confusing hyperlinks, circular references to documents, no ability to comprehensively and functionally search across documents, and misleading or inaccurate statements about what specific pages describe to the viewer. In other words: it\u2019s a usability disaster.\n\nSearching \u201cMeta privacy policy\u201d online brings up a [page on Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) titled \u201cWhat is the Privacy Policy and what does it cover?\u201d It\u2019s remarkably long. It\u2019s broken up into many subsections. It\u2019s difficult to search. It\u2019s hard to navigate. And, at the time of this writing, that webpage alone had 168 links to various other webpages and pop-ups within the page.\n\nIf you click on just one of those, such as \u201c [Review the privacy policies of the other Meta companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678),\u201d it brings you to a page called \u201c [The Meta Companies](https://web.archive.org/web/20241008070028/https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678)\u201d which then links to terms for Meta Payments, Facebook Payments International, and more. When I clicked on the [EU privacy terms for Facebook Payments Limited International](https://web.archive.org/web/20240927014044/https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/EU_privacy), it directed me to a page with no information on it that prompted me to log into a Facebook.com account. One page claims to tell you something useful and points to many other pages and popups, which also tell you you\u2019ll get the information you want\u2014if you just click one more hyperlink. It\u2019s turtles all the way down.\n\nDesigning privacy information in this way makes it nearly impossible for the average user to understand what Meta does with respect to a specific product, service, or technology. Looking to learn what information is [collected and transmitted](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites) via the Meta Pixel? If you\u2019re hoping for a quick read, good luck. Meta breaks its Pixel documentation into numerous pages, and when you click on a link on the Pixel [Advanced Matching page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/advanced/advanced-matching) that claims to help you \u201clearn what data is sent when using the Meta Pixel,\u201d it directs you to the [general page](https://transparency.meta.com/) for Meta\u2019s Transparency Center. Now, we\u2019re back where we started above, with numerous subsections and 168 links and pop-ups. Only by pulling together information from [many](https://web.archive.org/web/20241006044549/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/) [different](https://web.archive.org/web/20241003134755/https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#custom-events) webpages is it possible for a user to even _see_ all the information Meta posts about what data the Meta Pixel can transmit. (That\u2019s before attempting to understand it.)\n\nTake another example. Maybe you\u2019re concerned about Meta [saying](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/meta-will-start-collecting-anonymized-data-about-quest-headset-usage/) in February 2024 it would begin collecting what it called \u201canonymized\u201d device usage data about Oculus headsets\u2014at the same time as Meta [ended](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4503393-meta-set-to-delete-all-oculus-account-data-by-end-of-march/) consumers\u2019 ability to use an Oculus Quest headset without creating a Meta account or linking it to an existing one. Well, learning about that topic is a nightmare, too. The webpage for \u201c [Legal Documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20240926134919/https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/)\u201d about Quest devices links to dozens of different webpages, including a variety of \u201csupplemental\u201d policies and documents, that themselves have many links and subsections, again perpetuating the same design and layout problem. It would take hours just to pull together the information, before any work on consolidation and interpretation.\n\nMeta didn\u2019t always display its privacy information this way. But over the years, the company (once eponymously known for its first product, Facebook) has presented its privacy policy in an [increasingly graphics-oriented format](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/13/facebook-updates-privacy-policy-data), riddled with drop-downs and buttons. The substance of that evolving set of privacy policies, as [pointed out](https://archive.epic.org/2014/12/facebook-revises-privacy-polic.html) by nonprofit groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has made clear the company has continued to collect and use individuals\u2019 data without meaningful consent. Yet, the days when users could use a little CTRL+F or CMD+F magic to search for words within a page are in the rearview mirror. Meta\u2019s design and display decisions have made answering basic questions\u2014such as \u201cwhat data does Meta gather via virtual reality headsets?\u201d or \u201cfrom which apps and services does Meta collect fine-grained geolocation data?\u201d\u2014virtually impossible for the average user. You can\u2019t even attempt to understand what you can\u2019t easily access in the first place. Given how much effort this confusing design must take, that might be Meta\u2019s very objective.\n\n## **It\u2019s worse by comparison**\n\nTo be very clear, Meta is hardly the only problematic actor when it comes to privacy policies. As described above, privacy policies are rife with length, complexity, and other issues. Many companies drown their privacy policies in words like \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d or \u201cmay,\u201d and while it might make for fun semantic debate in a law class, these hypotheticals don\u2019t tell readers what companies are _actually doing_ with data. They also intentionally leave the door open to companies doing anything they want with individuals\u2019 data tomorrow or five years from now.\n\nThe privacy policy for Google, for example, is not the most accessible document in the world and [contains](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_138-149.pdf) many such hypothetical statements and privacy loopholes. It also has lots of vague language. But Meta stands out even from its data-hoarding competitors like Google and TikTok in just how badly it presents its \u201cprivacy policy\u201d information\u2014and just how difficult it is, should you have a specific question about a specific service or product, to find concrete information about what Meta does with your data.\n\n## **Where are the regulators?**\n\nAt a certain point, there should be consequences for designing the layout and presentation of privacy policies in completely unreasonably segmented, obfuscating ways. Perhaps it\u2019s worth an inquiry into whether such practices violate the US [Federal Trade Commission Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act) and similar prohibitions on deceptive business practices. Legislators should prevent these bad practices in future privacy laws, too.\n\nThe FTC, for its part, has been clear in its [enforcement decisions](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/D%26O-InMarketMediaLLC.pdf) that companies should seek \u201caffirmative express consent\u201d from consumers before collecting and using their data. Doing so requires \u201cclear and conspicuous disclosure\u201d to consumers of the categories of data collected about them; the purposes of data collection, use, and disclosure; \u201ca simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a document that describes\u201d this information; and \u201ca simple, descriptive URL (or hyperlink if technically possible) to a simple, easily-located means by which the consumer can withdraw consent and that describes any limitations on the consumer\u2019s ability to withdraw consent.\u201d Otherwise, companies may be in violation of [Section 5 of the FTC Act](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority)\u2014and its prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\n\nMeta does not appear to clearly and conspicuously describe the data it collects about individuals. It does not have simple, descriptive URLs for these pages\u2014in fact, any single privacy-related document on a Meta website could link to dozens or over 100 other pages and pop-ups that Meta purports provide additional information. Both of these points raise the question of whether Meta is deviating from practices the FTC has indicated are legally required.\n\nFurther, the FTC Act prevents deceptive practices in general\u2014 [defined](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority) by FTC [policy](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/410531/831014deceptionstmt.pdf) as \u201cinvolving a material representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.\u201d If any number of pages on the Meta website that claim to provide consumers with information about privacy do not, in fact, provide and present said information in a reasonable manner (or, really, at all), it likewise raises the question of whether Meta might be violating the FTC Act by deceptively _designing_ the layout of its privacy policy information.\n\nLawmakers working on privacy bills should not forget that substance _and_ layout are important for privacy policies, to avoid these kinds of bad practices that bury information from consumers and regulators, further limit consumers\u2019 ability to consent, and threaten individuals\u2019 ability to exercise their privacy rights. New laws on privacy should require companies to make their privacy policies clearly laid out, on a single or just a few webpage(s), in an easily navigable and comprehensively searchable format. Regulators should also ask the question of whether certain kinds of presentations of privacy policies violate existing federal and state laws, introducing the need to investigate and potentially enforce compliance.\n\nWe\u2019re long overdue for better laws, regulations, and technology practices for presenting data collection and use information to consumers. But in some cases, the design and presentation of privacy information is itself a serious problem\u2014and Meta might just win the prize for \u201cworst in show.\u201d\n\n#### Related Reading\n\n- [Researchers Consider the Impact of Meta's CrowdTangle Shutdown](https://www.techpolicy.press/researchers-consider-the-impact-of-metas-crowdtangle-shutdown/)\n- [We Know a Little About Meta\u2019s \u201cBreak Glass\u201d Measures.

How We Do It](#how-we-do-it)\n- [02\\. Privacy Product Outcomes](#privacy-product-outcomes)\n- [03\\. Technical Privacy Investments](#investments)\n- [04\\. Ongoing Commitment to Privacy](#commitment-to-privacy)\n\n##### 01\\. HOW WE DO IT\n\n## We\u2019ve grown our product, engineering, and operations teams focused primarily on privacy across the company from a few hundred people at the end of 2019 to more than 3,000 people at the end of 2023.\n\n![Photo of Chief Privacy Officer of Product Michel Protti on Meta\u2019s Menlo Park campus](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\n## \u201cWe realized we needed an order of magnitude greater investment in privacy\u2014the summer of 2019 was that moment. The degree of change for Meta has been massive\u2014it's required foundational changes to our people, processes, and technical infrastructure, and oversight and accountability. And we continue to invest in protecting people's data as systems, technology, and expectations evolve.\u201d\n\n\u2014Michel Protti, Chief Privacy Officer for Product\n\n## Governance\n\nOur work on privacy is underpinned by our internal governance structures that embed privacy and data-use standards across the company\u2019s operations.\n\n##### Privacy Product Groups\n\nAs we continue to integrate privacy across the company, we\u2019ve embedded privacy teams within product groups that deepen the understanding of privacy considerations by providing expertise within each product group. These teams enable front-line ownership of privacy responsibilities across our products.\n\n##### Privacy and Data Practices Team\n\nLed by Chief Privacy Officer, Product, Michel Protti, the Privacy and Data Practices team is made up of dozens of teams, both technical and non-technical, focused on setting and maintaining privacy strategies and enabling the rest of the company to adhere to them.\n\nThe Privacy and Data Practices Team is at the center of our company\u2019s efforts to maintain a comprehensive privacy program. Its mission\u2014to instill responsible data practices across Meta\u2014guides this work by ensuring people understand how Meta uses their data and trust that our products use their data responsibly.\n\nThe Privacy and Data Practices Team is just one organization among many across the company that is responsible for privacy. There are thousands of people in different organizations and roles across Meta, including public policy and legal, who are working to embed privacy into all facets of our company operations. Getting privacy right is a deeply cross-functional effort, and we believe everyone at Meta is responsible for that effort.\n\n##### Privacy and Data Policy\n\nLed by Erin Egan, Vice President and Chief Privacy Officer, Policy, the Privacy and Data Policy team leads our engagement in the global public discussion around privacy, including new regulatory frameworks, and ensures that feedback from governments and experts around the world is considered in our product design and data use practices.\n\nTo do so, the Privacy and Data Policy team consults with these groups through a variety of consultation mechanisms, including:\n\n- Privacy advisory groups that are in-region experts or have specialized expertise on topics like ads or Extended Reality (\u201cXR\u201d)\n- Workshops (including [Data Dialogues](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F04%2Fmessenger-policy-workshop-future-of-private-messaging%2F&h=AT2WTT70vFdM3fECyipmEyavf2scES-tPiGsmnF3BUooj99FBwGbSe1XLAcKk8g2Eh9HSxmhxffXW9vblJAn0RIVLFXaY_AriM5snaoiqRhognePLEUZC0YpuDEt13u6p5AHn7aIBylwKzpz1VT79w)) and other convenings on complex privacy questions\n- Ongoing consultations with experts as a part of our product development process, and to inform our long-term approach to privacy\n- Funding experts' research and advocacy around privacy, including [our privacy research and XR responsibility grants](https://research.facebook.com/research-awards/)\n- Funding experts to do \"deep dive\" consultations with us on how we can improve aspects of our privacy program\n- Support cross-industry organizations like [Trust, Transparency and Control Labs (TTC Labs)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ttclabs.net%2F&h=AT00cEE194qM9yE8Zbtnm1Cgz2lmtGMpa_UkWRMMGRgCcjLECQTLQZDartRf5zobBX9eVKPLEVl9a7TWM4uGAbpw99Z5IdRKoSvKwTXgovy8mOnM_iJEIxvB70XPVrUT5Qy2tKpXphankkXwPn0Msg) and [Open Loop](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fopenloop.org%2F&h=AT3e9-dp340r0SNEY8BdfE3E_xU4TJROXUwOR7_nY7tE3e3_JzJbig550L4M4Z0n0SM55Kh5duvIyOr90FmyG8R0S43sN35WjpbcOKuIMWNNBMW5HMWA0syeYtRJP3g5tExrQciX888MR-GyR7H-8w) that develop innovative solutions that help us and others build technology responsibly\n\nWe also host a [regular conversation](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D56bQVOv4uc4&h=AT1dqajrEl4Z0npxtXsq3yqkGvWM-z4VoBjQIJwySnwlBJYyTlaVTiVp_RkvaHOxIMpZ-5SUqOE2JZWtg40qCXQFf1fvxYeygYm1Bzg--J7sIFCcbwRKF56MvIYDLM0HxHvpxczYoGaSyUoKnXDkZg) series and an [annual privacy expert flyout](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F10%2Fcollaborating-to-build-privacy-first-experiences%2F&h=AT2EZZDvYv7MoJSRgDoTlS1dMv7DZMSSqx616qy_-PTmCIAsNbOKDuTdhM5VUcHyjJKoapW2JTNyvfkO0JN_AsQ5RaEIaGQtpRTA36cSor-CEXAML8jUET8pvfZprJhMap9Wl7rHWbWZDTC5dQ6gGw) with leading privacy experts from around the world to discuss a range of pressing privacy policy topics.\n\n##### Privacy Legal\n\nThe Privacy Legal team is embedded in the design and ongoing execution of our program and advises on legal requirements during the course of our privacy review process.\n\n##### Privacy Committee\n\nThe Privacy Committee is an independent committee of our Board of Directors that meets at least quarterly to ensure we're meeting our privacy commitments. The Committee is comprised of independent directors with a wealth of experience serving in similar oversight roles. At least once per quarter, they receive briefings on, among other things, the global policy landscape, the state of our privacy program, and the status of the independent third-party assessment of our privacy program.\n\n##### Internal Audit\n\nInternal Audit brings independent assurance on the overall health of our privacy program and the supporting control framework.\n\n## Privacy Education\n\nPart of ensuring that everyone understands their role in protecting privacy at Meta is driving continuous privacy learning and education that spans training and internal privacy awareness campaigns.\n\n##### Training\n\nA core component of our privacy education approach is delivered through our privacy training. Our privacy training covers the foundational elements of privacy and is designed to help everyone here at Meta develop the ability to recognize and consider privacy risks. Through its eLearning format, both our annual privacy training and our privacy training courses for new hires and new contingent workers provide scenario-based examples of privacy considerations aligned with our business operations and include an assessment to test the understanding of the relevant privacy concepts. These trainings are updated and deployed annually to ensure relevant information is included in addition to core concepts.\n\nAlongside our foundational required privacy training, we also maintain a catalog of all known privacy training deployed across Meta that spans topics relevant to people in specific roles.\n\n##### Privacy Awareness\n\nAnother way we drive privacy education is through regular communication to employees. In addition to our privacy training courses, we deliver ongoing privacy content through internal communication channels, updates from privacy leadership, internal Q&A sessions, and a dedicated Privacy Week.\n\n##### Privacy Week\n\nDuring our dedicated Privacy Week, we drive cross-company focus on privacy, feature internal and external speakers, and highlight key privacy concepts and priorities through engaging content and events.\n\n##### External Privacy Events\n\nWhen we participate in external privacy events like Data Privacy Day or our annual [privacy expert flyout](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F10%2Fcollaborating-to-build-privacy-first-experiences%2F&h=AT2mcyBxQ0F3HTJ6VyfNa1w8pFYkyQ2pUzZXErnVr9tA46x03pMhgiiUKjGlyusdG4gfZd5LzGtt0xRaJlveseMqHgnlWiu3VJc2yrTw5TG9c3eVwMdKuviTTqL_qGOrIkZrC-_Pi_CJhFwCplTbqA), we drive internal awareness and engagement through internal channels to ensure everyone has an opportunity to participate and learn about privacy.\n\n## Regulatory Readiness Process\n\nWe have a dedicated team whose job is to help ensure we comply with global privacy and data regulations. Our regulatory readiness process is structured according to key privacy topics or \u201cprivacy areas\u201d (e.g., youth, sensitive data, consent, etc.) to help ensure that we\u2019re addressing privacy requirements holistically.\n\n## Privacy Risk Identification and Assessment\n\nWe\u2019ve created our Privacy Risk Management program to identify and assess privacy risks related to how we collect, use, share, and store user data. We leverage this process to identify risk themes, enhance our privacy program, and prepare for future compliance initiatives.\n\n## Safeguards and Controls\n\nWe\u2019ve designed safeguards, including processes and technical controls, to address privacy risks. As a part of this effort, we conduct internal evaluations on both the design and effectiveness of the safeguards for mitigating privacy risk.\n\n## Issues Management\n\nWe\u2019ve established a centralized Issue Management function to facilitate self-identification and remediation of privacy issues. This process spans the privacy issue management lifecycle from intake and triage, remediation planning, and closure with evidence.\n\n## Privacy Red Team\n\nWe\u2019ve established a privacy red team whose role is to proactively test our processes and technology to identify potential privacy risks. The Privacy Red Team assumes the role of external or internal parties attempting to circumvent our privacy controls and safeguards, which helps us proactively identify areas where we can improve our control environment.\n\n## Incident Management\n\nNo matter how robust our mitigations and safeguards, we also need a process to (1) identify when an event potentially undermines the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data for which Meta is responsible, (2) investigate those situations, and (3) take any needed steps to address gaps we identify.\n\nOur Incident Management program operates globally to oversee the processes by which we identify, assess, mitigate, and remediate privacy incidents. Although the Privacy and Data Practices team leads the incident management process, privacy incidents are everyone\u2019s responsibility at Meta. Teams from across the company, including legal and product teams, play vital roles. We continue to invest time, resources, and energy in building a multi-layered program that is constantly evolving and improving and we highlight three components of our approach below.\n\n##### Proactive Identification\n\nWe take a layered approach to protecting people and their information\u2014which includes implementing safeguards designed to catch bugs proactively, before they can become a problem. Given the scale at which we operate, we have invested heavily in building and deploying a wide range of automated tools that are intended to help us identify and remediate potential privacy incidents as early and quickly as possible. These automated systems are designed to detect incidents in real time to facilitate rapid response.\n\nOf course, no matter how capable our automated systems become, the oversight and diligence of our employees always plays a critical role in helping to proactively identify and remediate incidents. Our engineering teams regularly review our systems to identify and fix incidents before they can impact people.\n\n##### Bug Bounty\n\nSince 2011, we have operated a bug bounty program in which external researchers help improve the security and privacy of our products and systems by [reporting potential security vulnerabilities](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) to us. The program helps us scale detection efforts and fix issues faster to better protect our community, and the bounties we pay to qualifying participants encourage more high-quality security research.\n\nOver the past 10 years, more than 50,000 researchers joined this program and around 1,500 researchers from 107 countries have been awarded bounties.\n\n##### Transparency\n\nWhile we\u2019ve adopted a number of protections to guard against privacy incidents like unauthorized access to data, if an incident does occur, we believe that transparency is an important way to rebuild trust in our products, services, and processes. Accordingly, beyond fixing and learning from our mistakes, our Incident Management program includes steps to notify people where appropriate, such as a post in our [Newsroom](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2Fcategory%2Fdata-and-privacy%2F&h=AT2V5mu0EwSXcWurNYWLjoBIkEqDPtATNkJ4MLCdw2quiGFyAsyrun6s_N-3_RhAFwbotP7tKEnD3wPqA8AjU53kitZ2X34SwuYqH5uG4vLspcJ3idG4Wrsy33bB8f0z2iMeJ-VwsL7BniaRjv-oJQ) or our [Privacy Matters blog](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2Ftag%2Fprivacy-matters%2F&h=AT3XbpEcIVDwqc7YoyG8OmtO8oCd7xn9jhMnUtAHQ1NVFzhUUHXbph6ZMZQT5mA4AsS8IHagvxMsosO53QrI3bymSEsUcuatoNUwWEYZVInBZ4pyWW_Jdzi5rcuV7EgdJjpuBzGw7r1K7OjkgpIYoA) about issues impacting our community, or working with law enforcement or other officials to address incidents we find.\n\n## Third-Party Oversight\n\nThird parties are external partners who do business with Meta but aren\u2019t owned or operated by Meta. These third parties typically fall into two major categories: those who provide a service for Meta (like vendors who provide website design support) and those who build their businesses around our platform (like app or API developers). To mitigate privacy risks posed by third parties that receive access to personal information, we developed a dedicated third party oversight and management program, which is responsible for overseeing third party risks and implementing appropriate privacy safeguards.\n\n##### Third Party Service Providers\n\nWe\u2019ve also created a third party privacy assessment process for service providers to assess and mitigate privacy risk. Our process requires that these service providers are also bound by contracts containing privacy protections. Their risk profile determines how they are monitored, reassessed, and, where appropriate, which enforcement actions to take as a result of violations, including termination of the engagement.\n\n##### Third-Party Developers\n\nWe\u2019ve designed a formal process for enforcing and offboarding third parties who violate their privacy or security obligations. This includes standards and technical mechanisms that support better developer practices across our platform, including:\n\n- **Data Use Checkup (DUC):** Procedures and infrastructure designed to ensure that third party developers complete an annual Data Use Checkup (DUC), in which developers certify to the purpose for and use of each type of personal information that they request or continue to have access to, and that each purpose and use complies with applicable terms and policies. We\u2019ve introduced new questions and improved logic to ensure greater accuracy in responses and better comprehension from developers. We\u2019ve also created new tooling to centralize developer communications and requests for additional information into a single location.\n- **Monitoring Developer Compliance:** We\u2019ve developed technical and administrative mechanisms to monitor developers\u2019 compliance with our Platform Terms on both an ongoing and periodic basis. When we detect a violation, we take standardized enforcement actions, which, among other factors, take into account the severity, nature and impact of the violation, the developer\u2019s malicious conduct or history of violations, and applicable law when determining the appropriate enforcement action to take.\n- **Data Security Standards:** We\u2019ve also developed data security principles based on industry standards for developers to drive better security practices across our platform and the developer ecosystem more broadly.\n- **Developer Trust Center:** We launched the [Developer Trust Center](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/trust-center), a central hub on the Meta for Developers site that brings together material for third party developers on data privacy, data security, Platform Terms, and monitoring mechanisms that they interact with such as App Review, App Re-Review, DUC, and the Data Protection Assessment (DPA).\n\n## External Data Misuse\n\nOur [External Data Misuse](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2022%2F09%2Fdeterring-scraping-by-protecting-facebook-identifiers%2F&h=AT0JIOb0NBQP_O1hd30-r_mG0F98t_UNw_OQvSe5Ibjy6VA19n2-CrOGSnDt9Nsl-qMrLEhxg-uhJzXl9gNOC2afe5bjWzeS-Hn5dzUChq-j-HnhMp7SAxeLMD9h59BFe6NTxaZ_qDHMMsmDBEsElg) team is dedicated to detecting, investigating and blocking patterns of behavior associated with scraping. Scraping is the automated collection of data from a website or app and can be either authorized or unauthorized. Using automation to access or collect data from Meta\u2019s platforms without our permission is a violation of our terms of service.\n\n##### Prevention and Mitigation\n\nWe continue to invest in infrastructure and tools to make it harder for scrapers to collect data from our services and more difficult to capitalize off of it if they do. Examples of these investments include rate limits and data limits. Rate limits cap the number of times anyone can interact with our products in a given amount of time, while data limits keep people from getting more data than they should need to use our products normally.\n\nWe leverage internally generated user and content identifiers after we observed that unauthorized scraping often involves guessing or purchasing such identifiers. We also use new pseudonymized identifiers that help deter unauthorized data scraping by making it harder for scrapers to guess, connect, and repeatedly access data.\n\n##### Investigation and Enforcement\n\nWe\u2019ve blocked billions of suspected unauthorized scraping actions per day across Facebook and Instagram, and we\u2019ve taken a variety of actions against unauthorized scrapers including disabling accounts and requesting that companies hosting scraped data delete it.\n\n## Privacy Review\n\nThe Privacy Review process is a central part of developing new and updated products, services, and practices at Meta. Through this process, we assess how data will be used and protected as a part of new or updated products, services and practices. We review an average of 1,200 products, features and data practices per month across the company before they ship to assess and mitigate privacy risks.\n\nAs a part of the process, a cross-functional team of privacy experts evaluates potential privacy risks associated with a project and determines if there are any changes that need to happen before project launch to mitigate those risks. If there is a disagreement on the assessment of applicable risks or the proposed product mitigations, the process requires teams to escalate to product and policy leadership and ultimately the CEO for further evaluation and decision.\n\nThe development of our new or modified products, services or practices through the Privacy Review process is guided by our internal privacy expectations, which include:\n\n1. **Purpose Limitation**: Process data only for a limited, clearly stated purpose that provides value to people.\n2. **Data Minimization**: Collect and create the minimum amount of data required to support clearly stated purposes.\n3. **Data Retention**: Keep data for only as long as it is actually required to support clearly stated purposes.\n4. **External Data Misuse**: Protect data from abuse, accidental loss, and access by unauthorized third parties.\n5. **Transparency and Control**: Communicate product behavior and data practices proactively, clearly and honestly. Whenever possible and appropriate, give people control over our practices.\n6. **Data Access and Management**: Provide people the ability to access and manage the data that we have collected or created about them.\n7. **Fairness**: Build products that identify and mitigate risk for vulnerable populations, and ensure value is created for people.\n8. **Accountability**: Maintain internal process and technical controls across our decisions, products and practices.\n\nWe\u2019ve also invested in verification reviews and a centralized platform to support operating the Privacy Review process at scale:\n\n- **Centralized Platform:** We have invested in a centralized platform that is used throughout the privacy review process and enables teams to manage all aspects of their reviews, requirements and privacy decisions. It is a central repository that enables teams to manage all aspects of their Privacy Review process, including to search and manage the external privacy commitments that we've made as a company.\n- **Verification reviews:** Privacy review includes a technical review phase to verify and document the technical implementation of the privacy requirements and mitigations as well as applicable commitments for each launch. We\u2019ve designed a technical implementation review to analyze, verify, and document the technical implementation of privacy mitigations and commitments. This process, integrated with the tools we use to build software at Meta, enables verification that what was agreed on in Privacy Review was implemented.\n\n\n[Back to Top](#learn-more)\n\n##### 02\\. PRIVACY PRODUCT OUTCOMES\n\n## We continuously invest in product innovations that deliver privacy and controls that benefit our users.\n\n![Komal Lahiri, VP Privacy Review](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\n## \u201cBillions of people trust us with their privacy everyday. Privacy Review is key to honoring that trust and helps ensure that we innovate responsibly. Our primary goal is to show our users and regulators that we\u2019re meeting our privacy obligations and getting this right.\u201d\n\n\u2014Komal Lahiri, VP Privacy Review\n\nWe put protecting users\u2019 privacy at the heart of how we build and continuously update our products. We do that by building default settings and controls to make it easy for users to set the level of privacy they are most comfortable with. We also do it by putting privacy at the center of how we develop new products.\n\n##### End-to-End Encryption on Messenger\n\nSince 2016, Messenger has had the option for people to turn on end-to-end encryption. In 2023, we [began to roll out](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmessengernews.fb.com%2F2023%2F12%2F06%2Flaunching-default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger%2F&h=AT0WMFVP3Xg0lpJT_mbLjZlnP9GAJI8jFyfvV-r8-qm59v30aGSwU-99ufz0AreeNEubWBmYbehUc_uitbfHwtwbieTiotPMpyGUi5lHQDHLj2ftgqP7OpGVdIfx7GHyyFVPKsLUkxKwPu0WCisuYQ) _default_ end-to-end encryption for all personal chats and calls on Messenger and Facebook.\n\nThis has taken years to deliver because we\u2019ve taken the time to [get it right](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2023%2F12%2F06%2Fsecurity%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-security-for-messenger%2F&h=AT0jOctSWUAL3i3B_zfJRI04R4GzQRL6mjUgfrDYn9JxI8g6eZQj7cWtukzAR3LNL0ES1mWacJSn4dLnMeX3sEvDCrikDbXZbBxpFfzEi4T5iRxKE08-6YjsArwRKqfRoePU1DjRd-5kQBerDEqTPA). Our engineers, cryptographers, designers, policy experts and product managers have worked tirelessly to rebuild Messenger features from the ground up. Enabling end-to-end encryption on Messenger meant fundamentally rebuilding many aspects of the application protocols to improve privacy, security, and safety while simultaneously maintaining the features that have made Messenger so popular. Our approach was to leverage prior learnings from both [WhatsApp](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2021%2F09%2F10%2Fsecurity%2Fwhatsapp-e2ee-backups%2F&h=AT38jwzm-yBD_IiYfpbLNbs-a008S-bxgQNNhsFiuyxodbtNXzee3bOj1jakhvYH_UBpyoZRwaAJfThmY543ymyjscXDLg9uwc7s7RaI8maZ78USA_l5hwGNJXzwwenFsq3ia_9SphQ-lvodYC_wyQ) and [Messenger\u2019s Secret Conversations](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F07%2Fmessenger-secret-conversations-technical-whitepaper.pdf&h=AT1xXT7UpHb9aIpVAUHNsZtAkOgcD4lqLvt_bBZ46Ws8yuAEIOrpKmZoM0Dsr6-Tjcic-dxv5fC5cE_ly9prHvMC-iZzUhzOwHZYR7gIbhtscjNCblR8xgBVsfOhmT33xdbgPeNnlMVfBDDmnICnqw), and then iterate on our most challenging problems like muti-device capability, feature support, message history, and web support. Along the way, we introduced new privacy, safety and control features like app lock and delivery controls that let people choose who can message them, and improved existing safety features like report, block and message requests.\n\nAt its core, end-to-end encryption is about protecting people\u2019s communications, so they can feel safe expressing themselves with their friends and loved ones. We worked closely with outside experts, academics, advocates and governments to identify risks and build mitigations to ensure that privacy and safety go hand-in-hand. We commissioned an independent [human rights impact assessment](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2022%2F04%2Fexpanding-end-to-end-encryption-protects-fundamental-human-rights%2F&h=AT0157ipXx8iO_oFP7pPqEOzfUQRKAEWIr3LGyVAb1u5f6c5QUo6DnS1hyCnoNGC_sNxw1yH2Dze21x5VonqzlUO4SfM_dyp11pwfog_D3TUrATE0ShFqQHoI2fKeqnyRHJ4QMWfAxU9homTUib-ng) and published an extensive [white paper](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmessengernews.fb.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F12%2FMetas-approach-to-safer-private-messaging-on-Messenger-and-Instagram-DMs-Sep-23.pdf&h=AT2WV0WwOIFdoXBxRKOu7XDYOmCDmaUNsbM0B70WxGONn8MvzdU1RrTzuAmzgCFtPl31FYx3ECFG4gQhKJiRL1ghuF3LoD76KbW8RtX08bKzRx6ERAqagVvaIn_LsCNAMnojv7zRkWK4erk6rDrpUQ) on Meta\u2019s approach to safer private messaging on Messenger and Instagram DMs.\n\n##### Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses\n\nRay-Ban Meta smart glasses let you snap a photo or video clip from your unique point of view, listen to music or take a call, and use smart features as they roll out\u2014all without having to pull out your phone. Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have been redesigned with a higher quality camera, improved audio and microphone systems, and new features, such as livestreaming and built-in Meta AI, so you don\u2019t have to choose between capturing the moment and experiencing it.\n\n[Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-collection-pre-orders/) were built with privacy at their core, and serve as a clear proofpoint of our commitment to responsible innovation and privacy by design. We\u2019ve incorporated stakeholder feedback\u2014which we obtained early on from the moment we launched Ray-Ban Stories\u2014in meaningful and tangible ways.\n\n- The capture LED is now more noticeable and visible with a differentiated signaling pattern\u2014solid to blinking\u2014for longer-duration capture (video recording, live streaming).\n- We also introduced a tamper detection feature to prevent users from recording while the capture LED is fully covered. If the capture LED is fully obscured, the user will not be able to utilize the camera and will be notified to remove the obfuscation before proceeding.\n- The Meta View companion app continues to provide easy access to privacy settings to manage information and additional data sharing with Meta.\n\n##### Generative AI Features\n\nWe launched [new generative AI experiences](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2024%2F09%2Fmetas-ai-product-news-connect%2F&h=AT3PVPtZT0Zf0sSkVZIt_7Oie8i4a3dxTdN0Qwiwia2UH9HCV-T0r-iwCUGju4Dr4vio0BcjWhXwk_Dz6P_nqOAUsexh7tf5tSA8FLW67jdKwuh2K0QBUgQT5NCQLipsYKSGT5EtfwdRAQSWzVi-MA), including AI stickers, image editing with AI, our AI assistant known as Meta AI, and AI Studio, where people can create their own custom AI. We\u2019ve included important privacy measures as we built these promising new generative AI features and have developed a [Generative AI Privacy Guide](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/genai?entry_point=) and other transparency resources for people to understand how we built our AI models, how our AI features work, and what choices and data privacy rights they have.\n\n##### Why Am I Seeing This\n\nLast year, we updated our [\u201cWhy am I seeing this?\u201d](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2023%2F02%2Fincreasing-our-ads-transparency%2F&h=AT3hG-ABMhcG8RU4xVJLMj3JneQAnMfNGTN59VPfm6Fez-CPmoMl_qoo6KqgUhOTwNNTWP940-1y2Zh0HmYDMe8dG6qoQIAQ4LHZs03RU6gWG1caRqmkHDMi_B69MYYxQz9mcgT9pC2a8qs1ixpR3A) tool, which aims to help people understand why they\u2019re seeing the ads they do on Facebook and Instagram feeds. One key update was summarizing information into topics about how activity both on and off our technologies\u2014such as liking a post on a friend\u2019s Facebook page or visiting a sports website\u2014may inform the machine learning models we use to shape and deliver the ads seen. We also introduced new examples and illustrations explaining how our machine learning models connect various topics to show relevant ads. Additionally, we introduced more ways for users to find our ads controls, providing the availability to access Ads Preferences from additional pages in the \u201cWhy am I seeing this ad?\u201d tool.\n\n##### Meta Content Library and API Tools\n\nWe developed the Meta Content Library (MCL) and API, new research tools that provide qualified researchers access to additional publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram, in privacy-protective ways.\n\nThese tools provide researchers access to near real-time public data, including content from Pages, Groups and Events on Facebook, as well as from creator and business accounts on Instagram. Details about the content, such as the number of reactions, shares, comments and, for the first time, post view counts are also available. Researchers can search, explore and filter that content on both a graphical User Interface (UI) or through a programmatic API.\n\nWe partnered with the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan\u2019s [Social Media Archive (SOMAR)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsocialmediaarchive.org%2F&h=AT3Zgc9BmvFSdN792VjzFdY5y7GawE_VY_hRmXegpe5PIZMHHj5MeNhXQ5Dyi5Ta-9T8NzIllJvwBz4wbSqQS9A1BlpCYG6q-p-DQeRmDfEUySypTi8iLF2lTkRiObAr_fgX_Q1_oX0cZx8rMKm4AQ) initiative to share public data from our platforms, where access to restricted data is tightly controlled, and authorized users agree to strict data use and confidentiality terms to gain access.\n\n##### Educating People About Privacy\n\nOur work to communicate transparently includes providing external education to improve people\u2019s understanding and awareness of our practices and ensuring information is accessible and easy to find.\n\n- [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/), which details how we collect, use, share, retain, and transfer information, as well as what rights and controls people have over their privacy.\n- [Privacy Center](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/center/), where people can go to better understand our practices so they can make informed decisions about their privacy in a way that is right for them. Through education and access to privacy and security controls, we address some of the most common privacy concerns from the billions of people who spend their time with us everyday. Privacy Center has several modules, including sharing, collection, use, security, youth, generative AI, and ads, to directly connect an issue or concern with the relevant privacy and security controls we\u2019ve built across our apps and services over the years.\n- Data and [Privacy Section of Newsroom](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2Fcategory%2Fdata-and-privacy%2F&h=AT1GsxygDTL5o_w37nX_MdcikLBSJEI2_D1Cq4_X7nXYeR-5Mc8UeAkfncBOzv-hclDchBCJbU17yiUuPKekZvbEGKeuLsTVD4bVO-R9HRoBTq6Pcps57WLUHzlDfETKZAwNbB9mN99bcT0J2-u44g), where we provide more information about how we\u2019ve approached privacy in the context of particular features or issues.\n\n##### Giving People Greater Access and Control Over Their Information\n\nTo provide greater transparency and control to people, we\u2019ve developed a number of privacy tools for people to understand what they share and how their information is used including:\n\n- **Privacy Checkup:** Guides people through important privacy and security settings on Facebook to help strengthen account security and manage who can see what they share and how their information is used. Privacy Checkup has five distinct topics to help people control who can see what they share, how their information is used and how to strengthen their account security.\n\n\n  - **Who Can See What You Share** helps people review who can see their profile information, like their phone number and email address, as well as their posts.\n  - **How to Keep Your Account Secure** helps people strengthen their account security by setting a stronger password and turning on two-factor authentication.\n  - **How People Can Find You** on Facebook lets people review ways in which people can look you up on Facebook and who can send you friend requests.\n  - **Your Data Settings on Facebook** lets people review the information they share with apps they\u2019ve logged into with Facebook. They can also remove the apps they no longer use.\n  - **Your Ad Preferences on Facebook** provides information about how ads work on our Products, lets people decide what profile info advertisers can use to show them ads, and lets them control who can see their social interactions, like likes, alongside ads.\n- **Activity Off-Meta Technologies:** Provides a summary of activity that businesses and organizations share with us about people\u2019s interactions, such as visiting their apps or websites, and gives people the option to disconnect their past activity from their account.\n- **Manage Activity:** Allows people to manage posts in bulk with filters to help you sort and find the content they are looking for, like posts with specific people or from a specific date range. It also includes a deletion control that provides a more permanent option, so people can move old posts in bulk to the trash. After 30 days, posts sent to the trash will be deleted, unless they choose to manually delete or restore them before then.\n\n[Back to Top](#learn-more)\n\n##### 03\\. Technical Privacy Investments\n\n## We\u2019re investing in technological innovations that deliver privacy benefits for our users.\n\n## \u201cInvesting in infrastructure helps ensure that privacy is inherent in everything we build. It enables us to continue building innovative, valuable products for people in a privacy-safe way.\u201d\n\n\u2014 _Michel Protti, Chief Privacy Officer for Product_\n\n![Photo of two people collaborating](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\n##### Privacy Aware Infrastructure\n\nWe continue to build privacy-aware infrastructure\u2014scalable and innovative infrastructure solutions that enable engineers to more easily address privacy requirements as they build products. Privacy-aware infrastructure allows us to increasingly use automation, rather than rely primarily on people and manual processes, to verify that we are meeting our privacy responsibilities.\n\n##### Minimizing Data Collection and Use\n\nWe\u2019re proactively reducing the amount of user data that we collect and use by deploying innovative tools and technology across Meta. We continue to invest in [privacy-enhancing technologies](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/building-the-next-era-of-personalized-experiences) (PETs)\u2014technologies based on advanced cryptographic and statistical techniques that help to minimize the data we collect, process and use and have been working to open source this work in cases where useful for the broader ecosystem, including on PETs for AI through [PyTorch](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fopensource.fb.com%2Fprojects%2Fpytorch&h=AT3eFNESyOZbMM8ZnlaNICvzHIBMia0dU50dRfxQT_FqqcPsiB5NasOZJu0Dty_iIvsEgOZBLPddfHkjQeWbClyCw81ACaMKIjIWyh68IgcBomtww5D6fr5vi6pzg3jo63UvKxN3kmPrrCBU03zgVA). Additionally, our investments in PETs helped enable a [new cryptographic security feature](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2023%2F04%2F13%2Fsecurity%2Fwhatsapp-key-transparency%2F&h=AT39iNhfkXCZk0ThceCGRmAkcMXDkyM4QVHcRoUD9v1MYqmU0MjDzW7aWIaNXrGsfk8ZuvWzRbGQA5sYAdjG1Z3sBalyuQIpcnJviJTuqFeX-Kiv33O08WQmYm0Kxexoyn-HQJHZRfweIh5vg4e9mA) on WhatsApp that helps to verify that your connection and conversation is secure based on key transparency. This feature reduces the possibility of a third party impersonating the person or business a user wants to connect and share encrypted messages with, by checking the validity of public keys in the conversation against a server-side directory that stores public keys with user information and then providing a publicly available, privacy-preserving audit record for anyone to verify that data has not been deleted or modified in the directory.\n\n##### Product Deprecation Infrastructure\n\nSimilarly, we developed a [framework for code and asset removal](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2023%2F10%2F17%2Fdata-infrastructure%2Fautomating-product-deprecation-meta%2F&h=AT1mnFPPRk0EoAbdNHxJEhUzhyJ7QE-wQ4pDw8NybhGhH45zPEwFHHX7uyPGPjndojyCWj4598r8LU8RCHEtpPZ2KT0-cBlIOYE6s54YYU1VQEm3H9EpYMOAz49cdwz1E5I2f5UBzHw7fTJJ7xF3Am1gNO67GSloI_E) which guides engineers through deprecating a product safely and efficiently. Deprecating products is a complex feat involving internal and external dependencies, including dependencies on other Meta products that may not themselves be in scope for removal. To address this, our Systematic Code and Asset Removal Framework (SCARF) includes a workflow management tool that saves engineers time by identifying dependencies as well as the correct order of tasks for cleaning up a product. In addition, SCARF includes subsystems for safely removing [dead code](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2023%2F10%2F24%2Fdata-infrastructure%2Fautomating-dead-code-cleanup%2F&h=AT23rTM5R6dFAK0-wgQ3xJd1ANocz_eo2MARdnuUyZKgrD2utWSDIObZ3Gkg3Zn5b7qWgyC5arU21TKJeRznww9pCm0xCbGtCRy3O7qkQHCWZ_uKG5J8Gq_ZXrQdstp84FXNrBlFHSicsE2Hvsv1fw) as well as [unused data types](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F2023%2F10%2F31%2Fdata-infrastructure%2Fautomating-data-removal%2F&h=AT1z8N8SncOVyQXPwrz6yn_uS2Vs2CQWdlY8H6rQMN_6tDUXpJTthY-C6p7O2-CTj5hRqkUdC3L9ooZcVsYRmcCK80pFXJhMDeFJ7_Q-f6ZSVP8-l6AxHhJzrJQgXdBEpa6qQhvMMnrJlQb3OZYYiw).\n\nSCARF powers thousands of human-led deprecation projects alongside the millions of code and data assets it has cleaned automatically. It is additionally useful for our privacy teams, who use the tool to monitor progress of ongoing product deprecations and ensure that they are completed in a timely manner.\n\n[Back to Top](#learn-more)\n\n##### 04\\.

This approach is consistent with how other tech companies are developing and improving their AI experiences in Europe.\"\n\nHowever, privacy campaign group Noyb says the policy\u2014which will apply to Facebook, Instagram and Threads\u2014is not quite as compliant as Meta claims. It has filed complaints in 11 European countries, asking their data protection authorities to launch an urgency procedure to prevent the move before it comes into force on June 26.\n\nThe data being used, it says, includes dormant Facebook accounts, as well as additional information from third parties or data scraped from online sources. Only chats between individuals appear to be exempt, it says.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\n\n[**Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23) [By\\\\\nKevin Payne\\\\\n\\\\\nContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/)\n\n[**Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23) [By\\\\\nCassidy Horton\\\\\n\\\\\nContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton)\n\nMeanwhile, says Nyob, users aren't given any information about the purposes of the AI technology for which the data's to be used\u2013against the requirements of the GDPR.

This is clearly the opposite of GDPR compliance,\" said Nyob's Max Schrems.\n\n\"'AI technology' is an extremely broad term. Much like 'using your data in databases', it has no real legal limit. Meta doesn't say what it will use the data for, so it could either be a simple chatbot, extremely aggressive personalized advertising or even a killer drone. Meta also says that user data can be made available to any 'third party'\u2014which means anyone in the world.\"\n\nNyob has made its request to the data protection authorities in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain. Given the fact that the new policy is due to come into effect in just a couple of weeks' time, Nyob has requested an \"urgency procedure\" under Article 66 of the GDPR, allowing data protection authorities to issue preliminary halts.\n\n\"We hope that the authorities outside of Ireland will take quick action and at least stop this project for a full investigation,\" said Schrems.\n\n\"The \\[European Data Protection Board\\] EDPB has already issued two such urgency decisions against Meta and the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. It is sad to see that this measure seems to be necessary again and again.\"\n\nMeta says it\u2019s simply following the same approach as other AI firms, such as Google and OpenAI\u2013and claims its approach is more transparent, and offers easier controls. In a [blog post](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/building-ai-technology-for-europeans-in-a-transparent-and-responsible-way/ \"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/building-ai-technology-for-europeans-in-a-transparent-and-responsible-way/\"), it says it\u2019s not using people's private messages with friends and family to train its AI systems, and adds that it\u2019s actions are in users\u2019 best interests: \"We believe that Europeans will be ill served by AI models that are not informed by Europe\u2019s rich cultural, social and historical contributions,\" says a spokesperson.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/EmmaWoollacott).\n\n[![Emma Woollacott](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/64efe03cc3c20701091e813e/400x0.jpg?cropX1=0&cropX2=278&cropY1=2&cropY2=279)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/ \"Photo of Emma Woollacott\")\n\n[Emma Woollacott](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/\")\n\n[Following](https://account.forbes.com/following \"https://account.forbes.com/following\") Follow\n\nI\u2019ve been writing about technology for most of my adult life, focusing mainly on legal and regulatory issues.

Just when you\u2019ve figured out a strategy to adapt to the latest shift, HHS, lawsuits, or Meta step in to rewrite the rules.\n\nThe most recent example of this comes from Meta. Meta is introducing new data-sharing restrictions for regulated industries, including healthcare, starting in 2025. These changes could significantly impact how businesses use tools like Meta\u2019s Pixel, their CAPI (Conversions API), and their App Events API to optimize campaigns.\n\nUnfortunately, Meta has been extremely vague in what these restrictions mean for healthcare organizations. To help, we\u2019ve been working closely with Meta insiders and leading healthcare brands to navigate these changes and to continue effectively using Facebook.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll break down why this is happening, what we know so far, and our interpretation of it.\n\n**One caveat before we dive in**: Meta hasn\u2019t officially confirmed anything you\u2019ll read here. These are our learnings from talking with dozens of healthcare organizations and Meta insiders over the past few weeks. We\u2019re still working to get official confirmation on all of it. [Sign up for our newsletter](https://info.freshpaint.io/freshpaint-5-newsletter), the Freshpaint 5, to stay up to date on our latest learnings.\n\n## Why Is Meta Making These Changes?\n\nMeta\u2019s new data-sharing restrictions are less about innovation and more about self-preservation. Here\u2019s what\u2019s driving the shift:\n\n- **Lawsuits**: Meta has been named in several lawsuits over its data collection practices in healthcare, particularly for mishandling sensitive health information. These challenges have put the social media giant under intense scrutiny, prompting the need to reduce liability.\n- **Regulatory Complexity**: With a growing number of [state-level privacy laws](https://www.freshpaint.io/blog/how-state-level-privacy-laws-impact-health-data-in-the-u-s), Meta faces the challenge of complying with a patchwork of regulations. Rather than addressing each state\u2019s requirements individually, Meta is adopting universal compliance measures to simplify its approach.\n- **Public Sentiment**: Increasing awareness and concern around data privacy, especially in healthcare, have further pressured Meta to act. High-profile breaches and growing distrust in how companies handle sensitive data have made it clear that protecting user privacy is no longer optional\u2014it\u2019s essential for maintaining trust and credibility.\n\nThese drivers make it clear: Meta\u2019s focus isn\u2019t on eliminating healthcare advertising but on minimizing its own risk in an increasingly complex and privacy-conscious landscape.\n\n## What Do We Know About These Changes (So Far)?\n\nFirst, Meta is grouping healthcare organizations into a broad category like \"Health & Wellness.\" From there, you\u2019ll get further grouped into a subcategory such as \u201cProvider\u201d or \u201cPatient Portal.\u201d\n\nThey make this determination based on the source of the data you share with Meta. So if you\u2019re sharing data from your website, your app, or an authorized (logged in) patient portal, that\u2019s what determines the categorization.\n\nThe \"Patient Portal\" categorization is expected to face the most stringent restrictions. Meta defines this category as organizations that share data originating from an authorized (logged-in) patient portal. Essentially, if users create a profile to access services and any data related to that profile \u2014 such as preferences or activity \u2014 is shared with Meta, your organization may be classified as a Patient Portal. This classification increases the likelihood of facing full restrictions on lower-funnel events and data sharing capabilities.\n\nBut, restrictions are not just limited to patient portals, the content on your website, app, or patient portal also seems to play a role in categorization. Condition-specific websites, like a website dedicated solely to anxiety, could be heavily restricted. While general healthcare websites, like the website of your local healthcare system, might be less restricted.\n\nYour go-to-market approach could influence Meta\u2019s categorization too. For example, if your healthcare company includes an \u201ce-commerce\u201d component\u2014such as selling products online\u2014you may be more likely to face restrictions. Especially if you're sharing data back to Meta from a post-purchase state.\n\nBut regardless of your categorization, it seems likely that both Providers and Patient Portals are subject to data restrictions. These restrictions will mostly affect [standard lower-funnel events](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/402791146561655?id=1205376682832142) like \u201cSchedule\u201d or \u201cFind Location,\u201d and could impact data shared through Meta\u2019s Pixel, Conversions API (CAPI), or App Events API. As a result, healthcare marketers may face limitations in how effectively they can optimize their campaigns.\n\n## What Types of Events Are Being Restricted?\n\nSounds pretty serious so far, right? Fortunately, there\u2019s hope.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll be able to appeal your categorization every 30 days if you have a strong reason for doing so. This means that if you\u2019ve made changes to your data source or adjusted how your ad strategy operates, you\u2019ll have the option to appeal. It\u2019s unclear what the appeal process is, but it will be possible to do.\n\nSecond, notice our wording above \u201cstandard lower-funnel events\u201d The use of the word \u201cstandard\u201d is intentional because **_custom_** events will still remain available to many healthcare organizations, with a few caveats:\n\n- Custom events must be registered. According to [the documentation](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/344247017987537) Meta shared on this, custom events will automatically be blocked until you, as the advertiser, review and confirm them. Meaning, the responsibility is on the advertiser to approve custom events.\n- Custom events cannot mirror a standard event. So, you can\u2019t just create a custom event that is exactly the same as a standard \u201cFind Location\u201d event.\n- Custom events **will not** be available to organizations faced with full restrictions.\n\nThe final point about custom events is crucial: Meta is shifting the compliance burden onto advertisers. Meta said this to one large healthcare organization, \u201cWhile Meta\u2019s systems are designed to help ensure prohibited information is not shared via these custom events, you are responsible for the data you share and your compliance with our terms.\u201d\n\nIn simpler terms, Meta is providing the tools but putting the onus on advertisers to ensure the data they send is compliant. This means advertisers must take extra precautions when using custom events, ensuring no sensitive information (like PHI) is shared.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s not clear which standard events are restricted, we know that these standard events will not be restricted:\n\n- Donate\n- Search\n- View Content\n- Page View\n- App Install\n\nLastly, if an event is restricted, your ads won\u2019t be shut off overnight. You\u2019ll receive notifications from Meta about which ad sets are affected, and delivery & effectiveness will decline over time. Now, it\u2019s worth pointing out that \u201cover time\u201d is ambiguous and data moves quickly on Meta so a restriction could have an impact on your ad metrics very quickly.\n\n## How Leading Healthcare Brands Are Staying Ahead of Meta\u2019s Restrictions\n\nFrom our conversations over the past few weeks, it\u2019s clear there is a lot of ambiguity with all of these changes and who is affected. We know that not all healthcare organizations are equally affected, even two companies that seem very similar are being impacted differently.\n\nSome leading healthcare brands have shared that Meta has indicated they\u2019re not impacted by the restrictions due to their adoption of privacy-first strategies. These organizations are successfully navigating the changes by:\n\n- **Remove Meta\u2019s Pixel**: Remove Meta\u2019s Pixel from your site and replace it with a BAA-supported tracker like Freshpaint to ensure compliance (if you're one of our customers, you're already covered).\n- **Block PHI from being shared with Meta**: Remember, Meta is putting the onus on the advertiser to comply with their terms. Using tools like Freshpaint, that prevent sensitive health information from being shared with Meta, will be crucial.\n- **Use neutral custom event names**: Maybe the most important step in all of this. Since, as we mentioned earlier, custom events are still okay, renaming conversion events to remove specific intent (e.g., replacing \u201cappointment\\_booked\u201d with a generic label like \u201cevent\\_T4B9\u201d) is a crucial step.\n\nIf you've already heard from Meta and they're indicating that your data sharing is likely to be restricted, here's what you should do today:\n\n- **Create custom events that limit data sharing:** Ensure your custom events only reference the FBCLID (Facebook Click Identifier) as the signal for conversions and avoid sending any additional context to Meta.\n- **Use extra caution in custom event naming:** Be deliberate about event names to ensure they don't imply sensitive intent (e.g., avoid names like \"appointment\\_booked\" or \"screening\\_requested\").\n- **Plan for conversion optimization without patient portal data:** If restrictions persist, develop a strategy to optimize campaign performance without relying on \"Patient Portal\" data, such as using landing page views as a signal. **\u200d**\n- **Appeal your categorization:** If you believe your website has been incorrectly categorized as a \"Patient Portal,\" submit an appeal. Meta allows for appeals every 30 days. **\u200d**\n- **Follow privacy-first best practices to stay ahead:** This appears to be a \"CYA\" move for Meta, meaning advertisers who follow privacy-first best practices should be okay. However, since Meta hasn\u2019t provided definitive guidance, it\u2019s crucial to monitor enforcement closely.\n\nBy taking these proactive steps, some advertisers are maintaining the ability to optimize campaigns effectively, even under Meta\u2019s evolving guidelines, but it still remains to be seen exactly how it will play out when the restrictions are fully implemented next month.\n\n## Navigating the Path Forward\n\nMeta\u2019s new data-sharing restrictions signal yet another shift in the ever-changing landscape of healthcare marketing. While these changes introduce uncertainty, they also present an opportunity for healthcare marketers to double down on privacy-first strategies that not only ensure compliance but also sustain campaign performance.\n\nWant to stay up to date?

        "markdown": "# Understanding the recent changes to Meta\u2019s Privacy Policy\n\nMay 31st 2024\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, has recently updated its [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/), introducing changes that allow the use of user-shared information for developing and improving its AI technologies. Here\u2019s a simple breakdown of what this means, why it raises privacy concerns, and what you can do if you object to these changes.\n\nBy understanding these changes, raising objections if necessary, and knowing how to escalate your concerns, you can take active steps to protect your privacy rights.\n\n## **What the changes mean**\n\nMeta\u2019s updated Privacy Policy now explicitly states that information you on its platforms \u2014 such as **your** **posts, photos, and messages sent to AI** \u2014 can be used to develop and enhance their AI features. These AI features include generative tools like Meta AI and AI Creative Tools. However, Meta has assured users that private messages with friends and family will not used for this purpose.\n\n## **Why should you be concerned?**\n\nThe changes to Meta\u2019s Privacy Policy raise several privacy concerns:\n\n- **Broad Scope of Data Use**: The policy includes a wide range of personal data, from posts and photos to AI interactions. This extensive data usage feels invasive without explicit user consent.\n- **Privacy Risks:** The more data processed and stored, the higher the risk of data breaches or misuse. You should be concerned about the security and confidentiality of your information.\n- **Lack of Explicit Consent**: You did not clearly consent to your data being used for AI development, This undermines trust and control over your personal information.\n- **Continued Processing Despite Objections:** Even if you object, your data might still be processed if it appears in content shared by others who haven\u2019t objected. This lack of control further erodes trust in Meta\u2019s data practices.\n\n## **How you can object to this processing**\n\nIf you are uncomfortable with Meta using your information in this way, under UK data protection laws, you have the **right to object**. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### **Submit the Objection Form**\n\nMeta has **provided a form** that you can fill out to formally object to the use of your data. You can find the form through a weblink in the notification you should have received, or on Meta\u2019s privacy settings page.\n\n**Provide specific reasons** when filling out the form, explain why you object to the processing. You can mention privacy concerns, the lack of explicit consent, and any potential negative impacts on your trust in Meta.\n\n### **Here is the wording I sent to Meta earlier today (feel free to cut and paste)\u2026**\n\n**Please tell us how this processing impacts you (required)**\n\nAs a resident of the United Kingdom, I value my privacy and data protection rights as outlined under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). The processing of my information by Meta for the development and improvement of AI without my explicit consent impacts me in several ways:\n\n1. **Privacy Concerns:** The use of my personal data, including posts, photos, and messages, for AI development raises significant privacy concerns. I am not comfortable with my information being used in ways that I did not explicitly agree to, especially for purposes such as training AI models.\n2. **Data Security:** The aggregation and processing of my data by Meta increase the risk of data breaches or misuse. I am concerned about the potential exposure of my personal information and how it might be used beyond the intended scope.\n3. **Consent and Control:** I believe that my data should only be used with my explicit consent, and I should have full control over how my information is utilised. The lack of clear, informed consent for this specific use of my data undermines my autonomy and control over my personal information.\n4. **Transparency and Trust:** The notification suggests that even if I object, my information might still be processed in certain scenarios, such as when shared by others. This lack of transparency and the potential for continued processing despite my objection erode my trust in Meta\u2019s data handling practices.\n\nBased on this, I formally object to the processing of my personal information for the development and improvement of AI at Meta and request that my data not be used for these purposes.\n\n**Please provide any additional information that could help us review your objection (optional)**\n\nI would like to emphasise the following points to support my objection to the processing of my personal information for AI development at Meta:\n\n1. **Lawful Basis:** Under the GDPR, data processing activities must have a valid lawful basis for processing. I do not recall providing explicit consent for my data to be used in the development and improvement of AI. Therefore, this processing lacks a proper legal foundation in my case.\n2. **Scope of Data:** My objection is particularly focused on the broad scope of data that could be used, including posts, photos, and messages. The potential for such comprehensive data processing raises concerns about the extent of personal information being utilised without my explicit agreement.\n3. **Alternatives:** I believe there are alternative methods for developing and improving AI that do not require the use of my personal data. Meta could employ anonymised or synthetic data to achieve similar goals without infringing on individual privacy rights.\n4. **Impact on Trust:** Continued processing of my data despite my objection would significantly impact my trust in Meta\u2019s commitment to data protection and user privacy. Upholding my objection is crucial for maintaining transparency and user trust in Meta\u2019s services.\n\nIn light of these points, I urge Meta to honour my objection and ensure that my personal data is not used for AI development and improvement. I trust that Meta will consider these concerns seriously and act in accordance with relevant data protection laws.\n\n### **Meta\u2019s response**\n\nIn fairness to Meta, I received an email response within minutes stating that they would honour my objections.\n\n## **What else you can do**\n\n### **Tell everyone you know!**\n\nBecause even if you do successfully object, Meta may still process information about you to develop and improve AI at Meta. Incidentally, this also applies to non-users i.e., you don\u2019t even have to have a Facebook account for your information to be processed in this way. For example, this could happen if you or your information:\n\n- Appear anywhere in an image shared on Meta\u2019s products or services by someone who uses them\n- Are mentioned in posts or captions that someone else shares on Meta\u2019s products and services\n\n### **Help people if needed**\n\nI know that I\u2019ll be helping my parents navigate the Right to Object form later. If you\u2019ve successfully objected and there are people in your life who might need help understanding what these changes mean, and how they can object, help them.\n\n### **Complain to the ICO**\n\nWhilst Meta have honoured my objections, I have still complained to the ICO because I think\n\n- a lot of users will either not open or delete without reading the notification from Meta about the Privacy Policy updates; and\n- out of those users who do actually read the notification, some of those will understand what the changes mean many others won\u2019t.\n\nYou can [submit a complaint to the ICO](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/) but **only after** you have completed Facebook\u2019s Right to Object form and received their reply, otherwise the ICO will not take the complaint forward.\n\n[**Kate Fitzgerald Consulting Limited**](https://katefitzgeraldconsulting.com/) offers a range of [**data protection support**](https://katefitzgeraldconsulting.com/our-services-2/data-privacy-and-protection/) for arts and cultural organisations.

While Web 2.0 has revolutionized the way users interact with each other, many cite that they have lost control of personal data to big tech companies. For example, there has been controversy over TikTok providing users\u2019 personal data to marketers and, even worse, foreign governments (Maheshwari & Holpuch, 2023). Other tech companies like Meta used the same technique as TikTok to collect users' data to place targeted advertisements (Ellis & McPhillips, 2023).\n\nWeb3 is a rapidly growing market that holds immense potential for businesses. Experts predict that by 2027, there will be 1 billion active users in Web3 (Kshetri, 2022). Broadly speaking, Web3 covers the underlying technology (blockchain) and its decentralized ownership model (DAOs, Non-Fungible Tokens \\[NFTs\\] and cryptocurrencies), and includes some (but not all) immersive user experiences (Zhao, 2022). This study primarily focuses on the immersive user experiences available through Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, specifically encompassing virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and the metaverse. This research is increasingly relevant to the core business of our client, XRM Media (XRM).\n\n### **Importance of the Study**\n\nEven though VR, AR, and the metaverse are already a growing part of the consumer marketplace, it is still important to define these relatively new technologies since they are not yet mainstream. VR technology enables users to immerse themselves in and \u201cinteract with a computer-generated environment, a simulation of the real world or an imaginary world\u201d (Akbari et al, 2022). In contrast, AR technology incorporates digital elements or objects into the real-world environment in real-time (Akbari et al., 2022). The VR market is expected to generate a global revenue of $20.8 billion, and the AR market is projected to grow to $31.3 billion by 2027 (Statista, 2022). The market projections indicate the potential growth and opportunities in these immersive technologies.\n\nThe definition of the metaverse is still evolving with the development and implementation of immersive technology. Science fiction author Neal Stephenson coined the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d in 1992 ( _XR Today_, 2022). Since then, movies such as _Ready Player One_(2018) and _Free Guy_(2021) have depicted different versions of the metaverse. Matthew Ball, former global head of strategy for Amazon Studios, defined the metaverse in his book, _The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything_. In his words, the metaverse is \u201ca never-ending virtual world where everyone dresses up as comical avatars and competes in immersive VR games to win points, jumps into their favorite franchises, and acts out their most impossible fantasies\u201d (Ball, 2022, p.21). According to Statista, the market size of the metaverse is projected to reach $486 billion by 2030, with an annual growth rate of around 35% (2023).\n\nThe emergence of VR, AR, and the metaverse has created numerous new business opportunities, with investments pouring in from prominent companies across the technology and entertainment sectors. Meta (formerly Facebook) and Sony have made significant investments in VR headsets, while Apple has launched its much-awaited mixed reality (MR) glasses in 2023 (Statista, 2022a).\n\nAR products have become widespread in utility and game-based applications. Alphabet\u2019s AR product, Google Lens, has 500 million downloads (Statista, 2023c). Nintendo\u2019s AR game, _Pok\u00e9mon Go,_ has become a cultural phenomenon with over 70 million players worldwide in 2021 (Iqbal, 2023). Moreover, the metaverse has become a particularly popular area of interest. For example, Roblox, one of the most popular and financially successful metaverse gaming platforms, reported 55 million daily users as of February 2022 (Kshetri, 2022). Meta\u2019s Reality Labs program is expected to cost $25 billion per year for a decade, an amount comparable to the cost of the Apollo Space Program (Statista, 2023a). Such a massive investment highlights the immense potential of the metaverse as a business opportunity. However, it is important to note that the recent layoffs at Meta are reported to largely affect its metaverse plans (Hayward, 2023). In addition, Meta\u2019s VR platform, Horizon Worlds, reportedly remained \u201cbuggy and unpopular, leading Meta to put in place a \u2018quality lockdown\u2019\u201d (Mac et al, 2022). In March 2023, Disney eliminated its metaverse team, founded in 2022 by former CEO Bob Chapek (Thomas, 2023). These examples demonstrate that immersive technologies are still evolving, and success is not guaranteed.\n\nCompanies should analyze consumer preferences and trends to navigate the unpredictable nature of the market and mitigate risk. Our research yielded valuable consumer insights in this emerging field, which we have shared in recommendations to XRM. Additionally, our interviews with industry leaders helped us identify several business-to-business (B2B) trends, which should prove of value to the company.\n\n## **Research Frameworks**\n\nThis research is dedicated to answering the following question: How can independent studios meet the demand for entertainment content for both B2B clients and partnerships and B2C (consumer market), specifically in the VR, AR, and metaverse verticals? To answer the question, we have explored:\n\n1. What is the consumer demand for new technologies in the entertainment space?\n\n2. Is there a shift in demand in the type of content consumers want to engage with?\n\n3. What is the general understanding of consumers regarding these new technologies?\n\n4. What do industry leaders think about the future for these technologies and their entertainment applications?\n\n\n### **Methodology**\n\nWe conducted primary and secondary research to answer our research questions. For secondary research, we reviewed books, journals, news articles, and market research reports related to VR, AR, and the metaverse, which provided us with insights into their current status and applications in the entertainment industry.\n\nAs a part of our primary research, we interviewed 11 industry leaders, including professionals specializing in Web3, independent studios, journalism, publishing, and immersive technology. Furthermore, we conducted a consumer survey to collect information to assess consumers' current interaction with advent technology (specifically AR, VR, and the metaverse) and appetites for content in the space. The survey was launched on February 9, 2023, and ended on March 31, 2023, during which 206 survey results were collected (United States and Canada-based survey participants).\n\n### **Limitations of the Study**\n\nThis project's research has three major limitations. First, our survey was restricted to convenience sampling as our distribution channels were limited. Second, due to legal and ethical considerations, we were unable to gather primary data on Gen Alpha, young people born between 2010 and 2024. Finally, some interviewees may be biased given their affiliations with our client, XRM.\n\n### **Definition of Terms**\n\nWe used the definitions of terms below throughout our study:\n\n- Augmented Reality (AR): A technology that inserts layers of digital elements over real-world objects, accessible through smartphones, AR glasses, or \u201cgoggles\u201d (Gillis, 2022).\n\n\n- Avatars: Computer-generated 3D characters also known as \u201cdigital twins or doubles\u201d that represent users through motion capture technology or imaginary characters (Gartner, n.d.).\n\n- Blockchain: A shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network (IBM, n.d.).\n\n- Centralized Database: The system in which all the data is stored and managed in a single unit (DatabaseTown, n.d.).\n\n- Decentralized Database: Instead of large parts of the internet controlled and owned by large technology companies, ownership gets distributed amongst its creators and users (Ethereum, n.d.).\n\n- Gamification: Applying competition, point scoring, and other elements of game playing to digital marketing campaigns to encourage engagement with a product or service (BI WORLDWIDE, 2023).\n\n- Metaverse: An immersive virtual space where users and elements can interact through VR and AR technologies (XR Today, 2022).\n\n- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Assets that have been \u201ctokenized\u201d via a blockchain. They are assigned unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from other tokens. NFTs can be traded and exchanged for money, cryptocurrencies, original art, or other NFTs (Sharma, 2023).\n\n- Virtual Reality (VR): Computer-generated environments that users can experience through headsets and/or controllers, allowing them to immerse themselves in a simulated experience (Virtual Reality Society, 2017).\n\n- Web3: A concept based on the development and implementation of decentralized technologies, particularly blockchain-based, for mass Internet use (Nix, 2023).\n\n\n### **Summary**\n\nWeb3 technologies will only scale in the future. Forward-thinking technology and entertainment companies are already either planning or entering this emergent market. Our study examines how independent studios like XRM can leverage their knowledge of B2C demand for VR, AR, and metaverse content to meet their B2B client needs.\n\n## **Current State of VR, AR, and the Metaverse**\n\nAt present, VR applications are headset-based, with Meta\u2019s Oculus Quest being the most popular, having sold over 15 million units to date (Naysmith, 2022). However, when compared to the billions of dollars that companies like Meta have invested in VR programs, this number still seems relatively small. Moreover, global shipments of VR headsets and AR devices have dropped more than 12% from 2021 to 2022 (Vanian, 2022). The shift from isolation during the pandemic back to a normal life was a contributing factor to this drop (Osterland, 2020). A tightening of consumer budget due to a weak economy also cut down the purchase of \u201cnon- essential\u201d things such as VR headsets (Vanian, 2022).\n\nDespite these challenges, the VR market is projected to grow significantly, with an estimated value of approximately $20 billion by 2027 (Statista, 2022b). As VR technology continues to evolve, there is room for improvement in the user experience. One promising area for improvement is haptic technology, which incorporates vibrations, motions, and kinetic forces into the controller, enabling users to feel the sensation of touch and adding a realistic element to the experience. The demand for this type of technology is expected to increase by at least 16% over the next two years (Bor\u00e9as Technologies, 2022).\n\nUnlike VR, which is headset-based, consumers mostly use AR on their mobile devices. The AR market is projected to grow to $24 billion by 2027, with a significant focus on gaming, which is expected to generate revenue of over $7 billion (Statista, 2022c). AR is also very prominent in social media, with Snap Inc. reporting that in 2021, approximately 1.5 billion individuals utilized AR through social or communication apps in the form of avatars or face filters like Snapchat or Instagram filters (2021). This number is expected to grow to 4.5 billion by 2024 (Snap Inc., 2021). Moreover, AR has also become an effective advertising tool to capture consumer attention, with studies demonstrating that AR advertisements generate 94% higher conversion rates, compared to ads without AR or 3D content (Shopify, 2020). As Figure 1 shows, the fast-food company Burger King launched a successful AR campaign titled \u201cBurn That Ad\u201d in 2019 that saw a 55% increase in sales on the Burger King app and garnered over a billion impressions worldwide (The Drum, 2019). While AR has promising growth prospects, it is imperative to address several challenges, such as latency in delivery and inaccuracies in the camera\u2019s depth perception (ImagineAR, 2021).\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51d98be2e4b05a25fc200cbc/33a0cb02-8fa9-45c1-b60b-4e0795b23644/image1.jpg)\n\nFigure 1. \u201cBurn That Ad\u201d Campaign by Burger King. How it works: Burger King customers point their smartphone cameras at a McDonald\u2019s advertisement, watch the ad burst into flames, and receive a free Whopper as a reward. Retrieved from [https://digitalagencynetwork.com/burger-king-uses-augmented-reality-to-burn-that-ad-digitally/](https://digitalagencynetwork.com/burger-king-uses-augmented-reality-to-burn-that-ad-digitally/)\n\nThe metaverse market is still in its nascent stage, and current network technologies are not advanced enough to achieve a metaverse as depicted in fictional work (Ball, 2022, p.48). Currently, the metaverse is presented in diverse forms with the most prominent examples being centralized platforms such as Roblox, Fortnite, and Minecraft (Statista, 2023a). In addition to such centralized platforms, there are also blockchain-based (Web3) metaverse platforms such as Decentraland and Sandbox Metaverse, where users can trade NFTs and claim ownership of digital assets. Experts predict that by 2030, the metaverse will generate over $930 billion in revenue (Grand View Research, 2023).\n\n### **Consumer Awareness and Interest in VR, AR, and the Metaverse**\n\nWhile VR and AR are growing to be familiar technologies to consumers, the metaverse is comparatively still relatively novel. According to Ipsos, less than 40% of Americans are familiar with the metaverse, and only 10% of consumers have engaged with it (Peterson et al, 2022).\n\nDespite the current low level of engagement, consumers are curious about the possibilities of experiencing a wide range of activities in the metaverse, including social events, gaming, entertainment, travel, and shopping (Elmasry et al., 2022). A survey found that 90% of respondents said that they want to get involved in the metaverse (Accenture, 2023).\n\nGaming is still the primary motive for people to purchase a VR headset. Over 80% of US households that currently own a VR headset have used it for gaming (National Research Group, 2022). However, it\u2019s not consumers\u2019 only interest. A survey shows that consumers also hope to use VR for activities like visiting museums, attending concerts, taking virtual fitness and cooking classes, participating in social events, and shopping (Statista, 2022b).\n\nAR was first used for aviation, military, and industrial simulations but has since expanded its applications (Javornik, 2016). In 2023, one of the main motives for consumers to use AR is for shopping. AR enables them to try on shoes, glasses, cosmetics, and apparel without going to stores in a trend that is becoming increasingly popular (Pennington, 2022). Additionally, consumers have expressed an interest in using AR to experience conferences and live events like sports and concerts (Pennington, 2022).\n\n### **Entertainment Industry Applications of VR, AR, and the Metaverse**\n\nThe entertainment industry has been utilizing VR in different ways in addition to gaming. Yosemite VR, located in Oakhurst, CA, has become \u201cthe first permanent motion VR theatre in the U.S.\u201d since its opening in July 2022 (Sheremetov, 2022). Studios like 360 Labs, East City Films, and MindVR have created abundant VR content for their entertainment clients (Sheremetov, 2022). Musicians also have integrated VR into their live performances with apps like MelodyVR. Additionally, VR has made its way into amusement parks. For example, Coastality in Europa-Park and The Demon in Tivoli Gardens (Sheremetov, 2022).\n\nMobile gaming is one of the most prominent AR applications in the entertainment industry. Utilizing computer vision, AI, and sensor data, AR mobile games like _Pok\u00e9mon Go_, _Walking Dead: Our World_, and _Ingress_ provide users with an immersive experience. AR is also currently being used by artists and TV shows in various ways. \u201cA-list\u201d musicians like Billie Eilish and Muse have integrated AR into their music videos and live performances. The Netflix game show, _The Circle_, used AR to engage audiences by allowing them to scan specific objects in the show to learn more about the contestants (Petrenko, 2021).\n\nEntertainment companies have started to leverage the metaverse to strengthen their competitive footing in the industry. For example, studios are actively seeking ways to utilize the core technologies of the metaverse, such as game engines. Game engines are software development tools that allow users to create video games or other forms of digital media. The adoption of game engines has enabled studios to create special effects in _The Lion King_(2017) and _The Mandalorian_(2019) (Ball, pp. 118-119).\n\nDespite the challenges faced by the introduction of new technologies, the markets for VR, AR, and the metaverse are projected to grow significantly. The research cited above has also proven that consumers are interested in engaging in various activities utilizing VR and AR technology, as well as in the metaverse. Part 2 of this research to be published August 15, 2024, presents a detailed analysis of the current state of consumer engagement with these technologies, challenges in adoption, and major B2B trends based on our primary consumer survey results and industry expert interviews.\n\n* * *\n\nThe previous research was conducted as a core component of the Master of Entertainment Industry Management degree at The H.

        "markdown": "\n\n![All the AR, VR, and AI news from the Meta Connect 2024 conference.](https://www.digitalbodies.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/meta-connect-2024-300x151.jpg)\n\nToday, we will hear the latest news from the Meta Connect 2024 developer conference. Previous years may have focused on the metaverse (remember that concept?), but this year will go far beyond virtual reality headsets and dreams of an all-encompassing metaverse. The two-day event will definitely have news for those working in virtual reality, but expect to hear news on Meta\u2019s growing investments in both AI and augmented reality (AR). We\u2019ve long argued that immersive tech and AI would need to converge to reap the full promise of XR technologies. And with Meta investing heavily in both, they are well-positioned to bring it about.\n\nMeta\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, will also highlight the latest hardware in the Quest lineup and likely new developments in their AR glasses.\n\n## How to Watch Meta Connect 2024\n\nAs in prior years, the Meta Connect keynote will stream live on the [official Meta Connect website](https://www.meta.com/connect/).\u00a0You can also watch it on Meta\u2019s [_Horizon Worlds_](https://horizon.meta.com/event/2751429235020383/) if you are a VR headset user, though, from our experience, a flat screen is best. If you want to go into the details, the workshops for developers will be on the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/) developer site.\n\nHere are the primary times for the conference, with the opening keynote by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, which will begin shortly after the online stream starts at 10:00 am PT.\n\n- **US West Coast:** 10:00 Pacific Time\n- **US East Coast:** 13:00 Eastern Time\n- **UK:** 18:00 BST\n- **Central Europe:** 19:00 CEST\n- **India (New Delhi):**\u00a022:30 IST\n- **China (Beijing):**\u00a001:00 CST (26 September)\n- **Japan (Tokyo):**\u00a002:00 JST (26 September)\n- **South Korea (Seoul):**\u00a002:00 KST (26 September)\n- **Australia (Sydney):**\u00a003:00 AEDT (26 September)\n\n## A Quick Update on Meta\u2019s Announcements\n\nAs expected, we saw new headsets, improved AR glasses, lots of news on AI, and a prototype of Meta\u2019s forthcoming holographic headset. Here\u2019s a quick recap and we\u2019ll explore the developments in depth later on.\n\n### The Meta Quest 3S \u2013 A More Affordable VR Headset\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg began with a reveal of the **Quest 3S**, a new VR headset starting at $299.99, with preorders available immediately and an official release on October 15. A higher-storage version will also be offered for $399.99, positioning it significantly below the $499.99 Quest 3 and far below Apple\u2019s $3,500 Vision Pro headset. With the rapid pace of immersive tech developments, the Quest 3S maintains the same capabilities and app compatibility as the Quest 3. The key differences lie in storage capacity and display, and it will be a compelling option for VR users and organizations seeking a more affordable entry point.\n\n### Meta Ray-Bans \u2013 Smarter Smart Glasses\n\nMeta also introduced new features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses, including a remarkable demo of live translation (travel will never be the same), the ability to control apps like Spotify directly through the glasses, and a very useful option to record information like phone numbers or parking spots. One gets the sense that our GPS-based apps will recede into the background when this feature becomes popular. There will also be a limited edition transparent design, with Zuckerberg pointing out the irony of first trying to conceal the tech and now offering a version of the device that shows it off.\n\n### Orion \u2013 Advanced AR Glasses\n\nA key highlight of Meta Connect 2024 was the unveiling of **Orion**, prototype AR glasses with a holographic interface. Described by Zuckerberg as \u201cthe most advanced glasses the world has ever seen,\u201d Orion overlays holograms onto reality without pass-through, reducing latency. The glasses use voice, eye, and hand tracking as the main control features. Strikingly, Meta will also release its wrist-based neural interface (the result of a nearly ten-year-long project) for the device, letting it respond to finger movements to display messages, video calls, and more. Orion is still in development and won\u2019t be available to consumers, though Zuckerberg hinted that there will be limited developer access.\n\n### Meta AI Will Be Everywhere\n\nAs we predicted, the convergence between AI and XR tech is accelerating, especially with the integration into the Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg showcased new AI features for the smart glasses, including live translation and Meta\u2019s AI assistant with celebrity-voiced options like John Cena, Judi Dench, Awkwafina, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. Enhanced AI photo editing and automatic language translation in Reels (with lip-syncing) were also highlighted. Additionally, Meta unveiled its latest AI model, Llama 3.2, enabling developers to create new AI tools.\n\nThe head-on competition with OpenAI was evident as Zuckerberg highlighted Meta\u2019s AI assistant\u2019s popularity with 500 million active users. He expects it to become the most-used AI assistant by the end of 2024. Given that it is free and that OpenAI is limiting its advanced feature to Plus subscribers, we\u2019re not about to challenge his prediction.\n\n## AI Developments and its Role in Immersive Technologies\n\n![Meta AI will be a focus of the Meta Connect 2024 conference.](https://www.digitalbodies.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/meta-ai-1024x714.jpg)\n\nAlong with Google, Microsoft, and others, Meta has significantly ramped up its AI capabilities over the past year, integrating **generative AI** tools across its platforms like Instagram and Facebook. These AI advancements, including chatbot assistants and its Llama large language model, are poised to influence not just digital advertising but the way AI interacts with human creativity and knowledge-sharing. However, the real interest at Meta Connect 2024 will be in how AI is getting integrated with Meta\u2019s AR and VR hardware.\n\n## Augmented Reality: A New Layer for Everyday Life\n\nThough much of the early hype around Meta focused on fully immersive VR, we expect this year\u2019s Connect conference to place greater emphasis on augmented reality\u2014specifically, Meta\u2019s **Ray-Ban smart glasses**. AR devices are finally getting to the small form factor that users will be ready to embrace, though it may be another year before Meta fully resolves the hardware challenges. Generative AI will play a significant role in creating a device that is immediately responsive to its environment.\n\nThe potential for AR glasses in business, education, and the arts is profound. With the ability to overlay virtual and interactive content onto real-world environments, they will transform the ways we work, learn, and entertain ourselves.\u00a0For artists and creatives, AR offers a new dimension of expression. The technology enables interactive exhibitions, public art installations, and live performances that react to the environment or even the audience. It invites the public to engage with art in new ways, making it more accessible and participatory.\n\n## A Turning Point for the Metaverse Vision?\n\nMeta\u2019s challenge lies in balancing these technological advancements with practical adoption rates. While groundbreaking as a concept, the metaverse has yet to see mainstream adoption. With AI becoming embedded in AR and VR applications, Meta\u2019s future doesn\u2019t just rest on VR headsets or digital worlds. The next steps in Meta\u2019s journey, particularly around AI and AR, could define how society uses technology not only to communicate but to think, learn, and create.\n\nJoin us for Meta Connect 2024 as we follow the latest developments in AR and VR and their growing convergence with generative AI.\n\n[Emory Craig](https://www.digitalbodies.net/author/emorycraig/)\n\nEmory Craig is a writer, speaker, and consultant specializing in virtual reality (VR) and generative AI.

The majority left on their own because of what they called discord within Reality Labs, but some left due to structural layoffs.\n\nThey asked not to be named because of nondisclosure agreements and a fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities.\n\nMeta did not respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s multiple requests for comment on this story.\n\nThe question for investors is how to reconcile Reality Labs' multibillion-dollar expenses within the context of Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d promise for Meta. Despite implementing cost-cutting measures and scaling back spending in Q1 of 2023, Meta saw its shares tank 20% after its most recent earnings report, thanks to a significant increase in AI investment.\n\nWith Zuckerberg back to breaking open the checkbook, is there enough room on the balance sheet for his AI pivot _and_ Reality Labs' steep losses? Although analysts and investors have remained patient on the long-term potential of AR and VR, how long is that leash more than 10 years on?\n\nMETASNAP PINS\n\n[Advanced Chart](/chart/META)\n\nBack in 2014, Meta (then Facebook) made its two largest acquisitions ever in just over a month. The first was its $16 billion purchase of WhatsApp. The second was of a smaller outfit out of Irvine, Calif., that had only developed a prototype of its revolutionary VR headset. The company\u2019s name was Oculus and the promise of its technology was enough for Mark Zuckerberg to shell out $2 billion \u2014 only a fraction of what he\u2019d spend on its development over the next decade.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn its first few years under the Facebook umbrella, Oculus's financials were grouped in with every other product in the business. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg became enamored with the potential of the Metaverse \u2014 so much so that he changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta.\n\nMeta also began breaking out its revenue and expenses into two separate divisions: \u201cFamily of Apps\u201d (which included Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), and \u201cReality Labs\u201d (a combination of Oculus and its other mixed-reality investments). In 2020, the former reported a profit of more than $39 billion, while Reality Labs lost just over $6 billion.\n\nThe numbers only became worse for Meta over the ensuing years: a $10 billion loss in 2021, $13 billion in 2022, and $16 billion in 2023. Furthermore, slumping sales and poor mainstream adoption caused Reality Labs\u2019 revenue to decrease annually. Since 2021, Reality Labs' annual revenue has been falling despite significant increases in spend.\n\nIn just the first quarter of 2024, Meta has reported a loss of $3.8 billion, about equal to its total revenues in the last two years combined. Analysts Yahoo Finance surveyed projected Q2 losses for the division would be closer to $5 billion. The lowest forecast we received was $4.6 billion.\n\n## **'Employee Bingo'**\n\nSeveral of the people interviewed blamed the dysfunction and cash burn at Reality Labs on chain of command reorganizations they say took place every three to six months. This included the promotion of \u201clocal heroes\u201d \u2014 or individuals that had succeeded elsewhere within Meta, such as Instagram or Facebook \u2014 who were then asked to replicate those results inside of Reality Labs. The lack of understanding of the technology often led to tension between new managers and the existing staff.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty chaotic,\u201d said a former employee who worked on the research team and said leaders were often pulled from the apps division with little VR experience. \"In software you can get away with that because you make mistakes and change things all the time. In hardware, you\u2019re stuck with your mistakes for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a senior director, they forklift you into any position,\u201d said a former executive in engineering. \u201cYou can lead an organization, set priorities, take on anything from Instagram ads to AR software design. It creates this really weird dynamic where the people in the trenches doing the work don\u2019t have respect for the senior leaders and the senior leaders don\u2019t really speak the language of the technology they\u2019re building.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey play employee bingo,\u201d said another employee responsible for AR/VR content. \u201cThey move people into AR that don\u2019t really understand it. It\u2019s hardware and experience, not a news feed in your hand.\u201d\n\nOne former executive in product management told us, \u201cThere's an arrogance there that says, \u2018Look how much money I was accountable for making because of this role I played in Facebook\u2019s Family of Apps \u2014 therefore I can obviously be successful at this new thing.\u2019\"\n\n\"I think that\u2019s probably the real story as to why there\u2019s been so much money thrown at this thing with such limited success today,\u201d they said.\n\nJust last month, several senior managers and vice presidents were quietly let go from the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. Their positions at Reality Labs included head of AR glasses hardware, head of hardware partnerships, vice president of supply chain organization, vice president of technology engineering, and head of silicon partnerships.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of traction AR and VR products have had in gaining a wider audience. Meta also competes in the segment with Snap, Tik Tok parent Bytedance, and now Apple ( [AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)).\n\nCircana Research analyst Ben Arnold says total AR and VR device sales in the US were just over $1 billion last year \u2014 a year in which Meta\u2019s Reality Labs expenses alone topped $18 billion. According to IDC's analysis, global shipments of AR and VR headsets dropped 67.4% year over year in 2024 Q1.\n\nMeta\u2019s current product lineup includes two VR headsets (the Quest 3 and Quest Pro) and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. But Arnold says software gains will be critical to the industry, specifically \u201cin content and applications that appeal to people beyond gamer.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s always been the challenge for this category,\u201d he said.\n\nA former employee said that at one point, there were 24 hardware products on an 18-month roadmap. \"You might be able to do that if you\u2019re shipping software experiences, but highly unlikely for an organization that has never really shipped outside of the Oculus space.\"\n\nThe source said management did not realize until too late that shipping \"a wrist \\[watch\\], sunglasses, new controller models, new VR experiences, new mixed-reality experiences\" was unrealistic, leading to low morale among the workforce.\n\n\u201cI had severe doubts about leadership,\u201d they said.\n\nEmblematic of that lack of direction was the scrapped development of Meta\u2019s in-house chips for its Ray-Ban smart glasses and other devices. In 2021, after over a year of design and build, Meta\u2019s vice president of AR Alex Himel abruptly canceled the project, instead returning to using an external Qualcomm ( [QCOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM)) chip.\n\nThe team was incensed. \u201cAll of us in the room that were software and chip people were like, \u2018You\u2019re insane,\u2019\u201d said a former executive who was directly involved in the project. \u201cPeople were livid over this. People left the company. This guy basically flushed millions of dollars down the toilet.\u201d\n\nThe cost of the internal chip was cheaper than Qualcomm's chip, according to another executive involved. \"It's illustrative of this mindset of not really taking the innovation piece seriously and not wanting to invest in long-term deep technology on the hardware side,\" they said. Himel did not respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAnother executive put Meta\u2019s spontaneous decision making more succinctly: \u201cI had anti-confidence in the roadmap. Zuck gets excited. Everyone rallies around what Zuck gets excited about. Boz \\[Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth\\] gets a budget based on Zuck\u2019s excitement, and then we go off and try to figure out what the product looks like. Over and over and over again.\u201d Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth did not respond to a request for an interview.\n\n![A woman is playing a virtual game of tennis using the Meta Quest 3, a virtual reality (VR) headset developed by Reality Labs, a division of Meta Platforms, at the Telefonica pavilion during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on April 2, 2024.

(Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAs for Zuckerberg's vision for his multibillion-dollar bet, sources say he sees the metaverse as another community he can own, similar to how he revolutionized social media with Facebook. \"He's really big on the notion of an immersive presence across boundaries,\" a former executive who worked closely with Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"When we were working on the Orion \\[AR\\] glasses, the top Zuck scenario was always immersive video calls. We did all the modeling on the heat and battery performance and we told him, 'Dude, we can do a call like this for five minutes and then the person's head catches on fire.' It's a power-hungry thing, but it's one of those goals he's chasing.\"\n\nAnother former executive said Zuckerberg is at the mercy of Apple \u2014 due to its anti-data-tracking efforts and Vision Pro development \u2014 so he's playing \"a big chess game.\"\n\n\"His bet is that the next thing after phones will be augmented reality glasses. Apple is making moves and he's trying to protect by investing in the future and hoping to own the next platform.\"\n\nWall Street, meanwhile, has its own mixed reality on the stock. Gene Munster, co-founder of Deepwater Asset Management, called Reality Labs \u201ca disaster from a financial perspective.\u201d Munster told Yahoo Finance that the stock would be higher if not for the significant cash burn inside the division.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives agreed, referring to Reality Labs as the \u201cblack eye of spending at Meta.\u201d Yet, both remain bullish on the stock, despite Munster believing that Reality Labs won\u2019t play a real role in Meta\u2019s future for at least a decade.\n\nMeta investor Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management called Reality Labs \u201ca giant insurance policy,\u201d saying Meta could always cut spending in the division if its other businesses falter.\n\nFor those insiders with \u201cReality Labs\u201d on their resumes, it\u2019s a different conclusion. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem responsible,\u201d said a former executive. \u201cIf I was a shareholder, I would rather see Zuckerberg putting all their metaverse infrastructure on top of somebody else burning at those rates. Let Samsung or Apple build that hardware.\u201d\n\n_Yasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Projections for 2024 indicate a potential leap forward, albeit rooted in ongoing advancements in AI, but also in developing high-quality chips that will give much-needed computing power. Our bet is still on the long-term success of metaverse. After the initial hype, practical applications will mark the years to come.\n\nThe metaverse, fundamentally reliant on the technologies underpinning it, could undergo changes fueled by the convergence of AI. Forecasts envision this synergy transforming the very essence of creation within virtual realms. Creators are anticipated to harness AI; Just imagine using the ChatGPT style prompts to create entire virtual worlds.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\u2019s assimilation into the metaverse promises an enriched user experience poised to propel greater engagement within virtual spaces. The seamless integration of AI into the metaverse is projected to elevate user interactions, potentially leading to prolonged immersion in these digital domains.\n\nRecent developments in 2023 by tech giants like Apple and Meta, with the unveiling of VisionPro headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses respectively, offer glimpses into the technological landscape set to unfold in 2024. These unveilings, though significant, represent gradual progress in the broader spectrum of metaverse development.\n\nAn interesting landmark lies in Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink, which [received](https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-neuralink-start-human-trials-brain-implant-2023-09-19/) FDA approval for its human clinical trial scheduled for 2024. Although its full potential remains a long-term prospect, Neuralink\u2019s brain implant technology has the potential to significantly influence the metaverse\u2019s evolution.\n\n#### Recap: Metaverse in 2023\n\nMetaverse is the biggest casualty of generative AI \u2018frenzy\u2019 due to the overall tech sector\u2019s shift to the development of AI. Even Meta which has invested [billions](https://fortune.com/2023/10/27/mark-zuckerberg-net-worth-metaverse-losses-46-billion-earnings-stock/) is shifting its focus on AI. Some analysts interpreted this as the start of Meta\u2019s back-paddling from the metaverse project. There are several reasons behind this, firstly some reports suggest that the VR market is [shrinking](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/19/vr-market-shrinking-as-meta-pours-billions-of-dollars-into-metaverse.html#:~:text=Meta%20is%20spending%20billions%20of,virtual%20reality%20market%20is%20contracting.), and other reports say that Meta\u2019s flagship social VR app Horizon Worlds is [failing to attract users](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/28/meta-horizon-worlds-metaverse-is-getting-an-update-with-more-games.html). However, the main reason behind the \u2018failure\u2019 or slow adoption of the metaverse concept is the lack of infrastructure \u2013 mainly quality internet connection (think of 5G), AI chips that can support this vision and affordability of devices and computing power. _In 2023, besides AI breakthroughs that will serve as the foundation of this concept, here are other interesting developments that will shape the future of metaverse._\n\nApple in mid-2023 [launched](https://www.theverge.com/23689334/apple-mixed-reality-headset-augmented-virtual-reality-ar-vr-rumors-specs-features) its\u00a0Vision Pro mixed-reality headset that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world. The headset is designed to cater to both virtual and augmented reality experiences, and it allows users to switch between AR and VR. [Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/new-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/) smart glasses gained the most media attention. These smart glasses are the next-generation wearable tech device that integrates AI technology, making them more intelligent than previous models and introducing many other new features.\n\n1st ITU Forum on Embracing the metaverse [took place](https://dig.watch/event/1st-itu-forum-on-embracing-the-metaverse) on \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b7 March 2023 in\u200b Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and begin ITU\u2019s endeavour to promote metaverse pre-standardisation initiatives. The forum\u2019s objective is to facilitate global dialogue on the metaverse, provide inputs, and discuss relevant topics that can aid the work of the newly established ITU Focus Group on metaverse. ITU Focus Group on metaverse which was established in late 2022 held its [first meeting](https://dig.watch/event/1st-itu-forum-on-embracing-the-metaverse) in March 2023. ITU focus group aims to develop a roadmap for setting technical standards to make metaverse services and applications interoperable, enable a high-quality user experience, ensure security, and protect personal data.\n\nThe European Commission has adopted a [strategy for Web 4.0 and virtual worlds](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3718). The EU strategy aims to steer the next technological transition and ensure an open, secure, trustworthy, fair, and inclusive digital environment. The strategy aims to empower people and reinforce skills, support a European Web 4.0 industrial ecosystem, promote virtual public services, and shape global standards for open and interoperable virtual worlds. The Commission believes a Web 4.0 will be the next generation of the internet infrastructure that will allow integration between digital and real objects and environments\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) [revealed plans](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/19/china_metaverse_standards/#:~:text=China's%20Ministry%20of%20Industry%20and,them%2C%20metaversal%20matters%20have%20meandered.) to create a working group dedicated to defining standards for the metaverse. This initiative aims to expedite the process of standardizing the concept of the metaverse. MIIT emphasized the importance of keeping pace with global advancements in this field to maintain alignment with international developments.\n\nThe US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [has given the green light](https://dig.watch/updates/us-approves-ar-and-vr-devices-to-use-the-6ghz-frequency-band) to a new class of very low-power devices, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets, to utilise the 6 GHz. This development is [expected to have a tangible](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/policy/us-allows-faster-6-ghz-band-to-drive-ar-vr-headset-industry/104640403?redirect=1) impact on the technology market by enabling faster data transfers and minimizing interference. For several years, major tech companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have been advocating for access to the 6GHz band.\n\n## AI and the metaverse\n\nAs AI technology continues to evolve and be adopted within virtual environments, it is expected to play an important role in supporting immersive experiences and the overall functioning of the metaverse(s). For example, it will render virtual worlds, drive digital 3D versions of chatbots, and enable real-time translations through natural language processing.\n\n### AI as the backbone of the metaverse\n\n> AI will play an important role in content creation for virtual worlds, with both humans and AI contributing to the creation of infrastructure, landscapes, and other assets. Advancements in technology are driving AI\u2019s involvement in **content creation**, including improvements in [3D displays for virtual and augmented reality](https://news.stanford.edu/2021/11/12/using-ai-create-better-virtual-reality-experiences/#:~:text=Stanford%20researchers%20are%20using%20artificial,virtual%20and%20augmented%20reality%20technologies.). Companies are already leveraging AI to develop [entire virtual worlds](https://techxplore.com/news/2018-12-ai-nvidia-explores-what-if-worlds.html), and 3D AI-driven chatbots are being created to enhance user experiences in the metaverse through personalised interactions. Furthermore, AI will also contribute to **content moderation** by detecting, flagging, and removing illegal, inappropriate, or harmful content across different media formats. Lastly, robust **identity authentication** will be essential in these environments, and AI can contribute by analysing biometric data like facial recognition, fingerprints, or voice patterns to accurately verify an individual\u2019s identity.\n\n### **Challenges at the intersection of AI and the metaverse(s)**\n\n> The integration of AI and the metaverse presents several challenges. **Protecting data privacy and security** is a primary concern, especially as the metaverse would involve the collection and processing \u2013 including via AI \u2013 of personal and sensitive information (going as far as kinetic, physiological, brain activity, and other health data) that could be exploited by malicious actors if not properly safeguarded. Additionally, **algorithmic bias and fairness** must be addressed to prevent the perpetuation of social inequalities within the metaverse. Fair representation and inclusivity should be prioritised to ensure that AI technologies in the metaverse do not inadvertently marginalise or discriminate against certain individuals or communities.\n\n**About the metaverse**\n\nIn 1992, Neal Stephenson wrote _Snow Crash_, and coined the term metaverse to describe a virtual world where the characters escape from their harsh reality. In particular, the main character of this book, Hiro Protagonist, a talented hacker that works as a pizza delivery driver, spends a lot of his time there:\n\n> _\\[So\\] Hiro\u2019s not actually here at all. He\u2019s in a computer-generated universe that his computer is drawing onto his goggles and pumping into his earphones. In the lingo, this imaginary place is known as the Metaverse._\n>\n> _Neal Stephenson, Snow Crash (1992)_\n\n## What is metaverse?\n\nWhile there is no common understanding or definition of the metaverse, some experts consider it a 3D version of the internet \u2013 the concept of metaverse is centred on how users will experience the internet. It is envisioned as a shared and decentralised, persistent, synchronous, and living virtual world accessible to everyone that complements the actual world. It will have unprecedented compatibility of data, digital items, assets, and content.\n\nIn a nutshell, the metaverse is a network of interconnected online realms in which physical, augmented, and virtual realities interact. A location where you and millions of other users live your (digital) lives through an avatar and interact, learn, do business, and have fun. The metaverse will alter our perception of reality with numerous impacts on personal identity, law, and overall societal organisation.\n\n## **One or multiple metaverses \u2013 the challenge of** [**interoperability and standards**](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/a-brief-overview-of-the-metaverse-and-9541020/)\n\nThere is widespread agreement that there should only be one, singular space. To achieve a singular metaverse, if one company builds a metaverse, others must follow the same standards to ensure interoperability. This would mean agreeing on the technologies and standards for multiple companies. (Already) over 35 tech companies, industry consortia, and standards developing organisations (SDOs) launched the Metaverse Standards Forum to \u2018foster the development of open standards for the metaverse\u2019.\n\nWhile relying on some other development(s), we might be heading down a different road, one that will include various metaverses. A number of potential metaverses were already announced, including [Microsoft Mesh](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mesh), [NetEase metaverse,](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3154871/metaverse-gathers-pace-china-baidu-netease-join-rush-register) [Nvidia Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) [, and Baidu\u2019s metaapp](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3154871/metaverse-gathers-pace-china-baidu-netease-join-rush-register), to name a few. These metaverses must be (made \u2013 developed) interoperable to enable users to seamlessly shift from space to space.\n\n## **Leading companies\u2019 vision of the metaverse**\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg [called the metaverse](https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon)\u00a0\u2018a persistent, synchronous environment where we can be together\u2019. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang [described it](https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/12/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-weighs-in-on-the-metaverse-blockchain-chip-shortage-arm-deal-and-competition/) as \u2018a virtual world that is shared by a lot of people. It has real design. It has a real economy. You have a real avatar. That avatar belongs to you and is you. It could be a photoreal avatar of you, or a character.\u2019 Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney [characterised it](https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon) as \u2018a kind of online playground where users could join friends to play a multiplayer game like Epic\u2019s Fortnite one moment, watch a movie via Netflix the next.\u2019 For Roblox, the metaverse is \u2018a platform for immersive co-experiences, where people can come together within millions of 3D experiences to learn, work, play, create, and socialise.\u2019 [For Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/converging-the-physical-and-digital-with-digital-twins-mixed-reality-and-metaverse-apps/),\u00a0the metaverse is a convergence of physical and digital worlds.\n\n## The building blocks of the metaverse\n\n**Let us explore and lift the bonnet of the metaverse and look at what is under.** The metaverse belongs to a suite of technologies that build on alternative types of realities, aided by wearable devices. The most well-known technologies are augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) \u2013 which is a blend of both. Extended reality (XR) is an umbrella term that encompasses all kinds of altered realities offered by technology. _It is important to note that these different types of realities provide different levels of immersion or how users experience them (these types of realities)._\n\n**Is the metaverse VR, AR or MR?**\n\nWhile VR, AR and MR are one of the most important elements of the metaverse, we might even say a cornerstone (of the metaverse), the simple answer is no, the metaverse is neither. These extended reality technologies will be just one of the ways to access and experience the metaverse. Although not the only way (to experience it), all it takes is a device with a screen, like a computer or a smartphone. The Metaverse is a much broader concept, and it is a combination of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), blockchain, Web3.0, artificial intelligence, social media, and much more.\n\nAugmented reality (AR) allows users to view the real-world environment with augmented (seamlessly added) elements, generated by digital devices. We usually view the combined actual and digital content through a handheld device or smart glasses (still often in two dimensions). [Mixed reality](https://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-augmented-reality-and-mixed-reality/#:~:text=In%20a%20nutshell%2C%20augmented%20reality,best%20of%20both%20the%20worlds.) merges the real world with the virtual world to create new environments and visualisations where objects from the virtual world and real world coexist and interact in real-time. We may describe it as enhanced augmented reality with some aspects of virtual reality \u2013 thus a blend of both. Experts forecast that users, for their daily activities on the internet, will engage in the metaverse through augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) for the foreseeable future. In contrast, virtual reality (VR) is [foreseen to be used](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/06/30/two-meta-insights-about-the-future-of-the-metaverse/) mostly for entertainment, gaming, meetings, and virtual learning and training.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) simulates 3D experiences using a computer-generated environment, allowing the user to completely be detached from the physical world and immersed into a digital one. Users experience Virtual reality using ocular technology (VR headsets or glasses) and, more recently, haptic technology, such as gloves and suits. [**Haptic technologies**](https://www.esafety.gov.au/industry/tech-trends-and-challenges/immersive-tech) are rapidly being developed and adapted for the metaverse to be used in combination with AR or VR. This technology essentially stimulates users' sense of touch; it enhances what the user experiences by adding tactile [response](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-haptics), so the user may 'feel\u2019.\n\n![A boy in purple submerged in the metaverse wearing VR glasses and watching the outer space.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20614'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nAnother emerging tech is a brain-computer interface (BCI) which is a part of [**neurotechnology**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733340/). BCI is a [computer-based system](https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/articles/neurotechnology-358488) that takes brain impulses, examines them, and then converts them into instructions for devices that ultimately deliver the required result. [Researchers predict](https://www.nomuraholdings.com/sdgs/article/026/) it will be applied in the metaverse to enable people to operate devices, interact with one another, and control avatars through their thoughts alone. Eventually, further advances would allow the brain to reproduce the sense of taste, touch, and smell.\n\nSophisticated algorithms and computing power are predicted to be key factors (or enablers) in the further development of more immersive environments. Metaverse will certainly require 'supercomputers' with a high-performance level; this is where quantum computing development comes into play. Quantum computing should add [computational power](https://medium.com/my-metaverse/exploring-the-metaverse-and-how-quantum-computing-plays-a-role-a1e227f93d2b) to the metaverse, VR and MR, resulting in more immersive and seamless experiences.\n\nVirtual worlds and their infrastructure, landscape(s), and other assets will be created by AI in addition to humans as the primary content creators. As technology advances, AI is expected to take a primary role in content creation. Researchers at Stanford's Computational Imaging Lab believe that [AI is crucial for improving 3D displays for virtual and augmented reality applications](https://news.stanford.edu/2021/11/12/using-ai-create-better-virtual-reality-experiences/#:~:text=Stanford%20researchers%20are%20using%20artificial,virtual%20and%20augmented%20reality%20technologies.). At the same time, [companies are already training](https://techxplore.com/news/2018-12-ai-nvidia-explores-what-if-worlds.html) AI to create entire virtual worlds. [Soul Machines is working on Humans OS 2.0](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746679/soul-machines-metaverse-digital-humans-labor), an AI-driven digital 3D version of chatbots that will eventually inhabit the metaverse, which learns from interactions with real people.\n\n## Governance and technology\n\nWhen it comes to governance, perhaps the biggest concerns are about our condition as human beings. Whom do we trust to run and govern the metaverse \u2013 is it tech companies, or do we expect countries to have digital twins of their governance structures in the metaverse? Web 3.0, the metaverse building block, offers a different approach \u2013 decentralisation. It is important to note that Web 3.0 is still in the process of being imagined, designed, and built. Much of Web 3.0 remains hypothetical.\n\n[Web 3.0](https://www.investopedia.com/web-20-web-30-5208698) is a notion of who would own and govern the internet of the future, rather than a new technology per se, although it is based on emerging technologies like blockchain, non-fungible tokens, and AI.\n\nDecentralisation [is an idea](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-decentralization-and-web3-will-impact-the-enterprise/) that ownership and governance should be divided among the internet's users and creators, as opposed to centralised corporations owning and managing it.\n\nIn particular, this approach tries to get rid of the current model of a centralised network run by a single entity (like social networks or e-commerce websites), but rather to take a step back in internet history and build the network on free and open source standards of the internet backbone. In theory, this could enable access to metaverse on a utility level for everyone (as is the case with the internet).\n\n[Blockchain](https://dig.watch/technologies/blockchain) is the backbone of what is titled [Web 3.0](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Web-30). Ownership over digital assets is foreseen to boost new types of economic, social and financial relations. For communities involved in a build-up of Web 3.0 based on blockchain technologies, [metaverse will in fact be based on Web 3.0](https://cointelegraph.com/metaverse-for-beginners/what-is-metaverse-in-blockchain-a-beginners-guide-on-an-internet-enabled-virtual-world), while XR will \u2018only\u2019 add the 3D and immersive component on top of it.\n\nBlockchain is the basis for allowing ownership over digital(ised) assets \u2013 be it digital money, art, or other types of information. Some known examples of blockchain use are crypto-currencies like bitcoin or Ether, in-game items like avatars, digital and non-digital collectables, ect. Importantly, blockchain has enabled the emergence of **non-fungible tokens (NFT) \u2013 digital tokens that represent non-fungible assets in the real or digital world (like art, music, real estate, or in-game items)**. Unique properties and ownership over those assets is stored in an NFT blockchain. Trading NFTs thus equals the trade of real or digital assets, while blockchain ensures a decentralised and secure track record of those transactions. NFTs can play a pivotal role in enabling the economic and trade potentials of the metaverse.\n\nHowever, this concept comes with its set of challenges. For instance, platforms [built on Web3.0](https://www.afslaw.com/perspectives/alerts/protecting-and-enforcing-ip-rights-the-metaverse) do not really rely on a single server. Instead, information is copied and spread over multiple servers via a peer-to-peer network. As a result, no institution, such as a hosting company, has the power to take down unlawful/harmful content. Another challenge is blockchain technology. Once information is on the blockchain, it is permanently stored and can only be removed through a consensus.\n\n## **Geopolitics and trends**\n\nThe global metaverse market [was valued](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/metaverse-market) at US$40 billion in 2021 and is estimated to surpass around US$1,607.12 billion by 2030. Another report by McKinsey & Company (\u2018 [Value Creation in the Metaverse](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/value-creation-in-the-metaverse)\u2019) stated investment in the metaverse so far in 2022 (US$120 billion) has already more than doubled the total investment for 2021. The same reports estimate the value of the market by 2030 to surpass US$5 trillion. Furthermore, the report predicts the e-commerce industry is likely to benefit the most, with an estimated market impact of somewhere between US$2 trillion and US$2.6 trillion by 2030, followed by the academic virtual learning market (US$180 billion to US$270 billion), advertising (US$144 billion to US$206 billion) and gaming (US$108 billion to US$125 billion).\n\nWith such market predictions, geopolitical competition is inevitable. As the metaverse idea goes mainstream, more companies, from the gaming industry to luxury fashion brands, are entering the contest. However, the state of play is ultimately the same: Companies headquartered in the USA and China are at the forefront of the race.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20934%20465'%3E%3C/svg%3E)Source: Fortune Business Insights\n\nCompanies are not the only ones interested in the metaverse \u2013 governments and their institutions are keeping a close eye on developments.\n\nChina has signalled it is ready to embrace the metaverse, but has also issued some cautionary messages to [stay rational \u2018in understanding the current metaverse mania\u2019](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/why-chinese-tech-giants-embracing-121619685.html). The new Chinese industry group, the Metaverse Industry Committee was [established under the state-supervised China Mobile Communications Association (CMCA)](https://qz.com/2089316/china-sees-the-metaverse-as-the-next-internet-battleground/) and may signal that China is ready to embrace the metaverse. Meanwhile, the city of [Shanghai has decided to encourage metaverse use in public services, business offices, and other areas.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/31/shanghai-releases-five-year-plans-for-metaverse-development.html)\n\nOther countries are joining the \u2018race\u2019, with Barbados, South Korea, Dubai, and Spain making announcements of their own. Barbados is planning to [launch the world\u2019s first metaverse embassy](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/barbados-to-launch-the-worlds-first-metaverse-embassy/) in the Decentaland metaverse. Barbados government is also [finalising agreements with other metaverse platforms](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/15/barbados-to-become-first-sovereign-nation-with-an-embassy-in-the-metaverse/) to buy land, build virtual consulates and embassies, provide e-visas, and build a teleporter that will allow users to transport their avatars between various metaverses. Meanwhile, [South Korea is investing around US$177.1 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/30/south-koreas-investment-in-the-metaverse-could-provide-a-blueprint.html), while its capital Seoul plans to become the [\u2018first major city\u2019 to enter the metaverse](https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/11/10/seoul-to-become-the-first-city-to-enter-the-metaverse-what-will-it-look-like). Its citizens will be able to access the cities\u2019 economic, cultural, tourism, educational, and civic services by 2023.\u00a0 Moreover, the emirate of Dubai [announced](https://wam.ae/en/details/1395303067141) the launch of the metaverse Strategy, which aims to turn Dubai into one of the world\u2019s metaverse economies as well as a global hub for the metaverse community. [The Spanish government promised grants](https://www.bonanza.design/blogs/how-cities-and-countries-are-investing-in-the-metaverse/) to small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) and independent contractors with domicile in Spain or the European Union who are involved in research, development, and innovation projects integrating Web3 and metaverse technologies.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s antitrust chief, stated that the EU is [analysing the metaverse landscape, before deciding how to regulate it](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/02/08/eu-is-analysing-the-metaverse-ahead-of-possible-regulation-says-anti-trust-chief-margrethe) and its potential impacts. Accordingly, the European Parliament [commissioned a study](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/733557/EPRS_BRI(2022)733557_EN.pdf) investigating the potential benefits and challenges of the metaverse, with aim to assist the Members and staff of the European Parliament as background in their parliamentary work.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has published her [\u20182022 State of the Union Letter of Intent\u2019](https://state-of-the-union.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-09/SOTEU_2022_Letter_of_Intent_EN_0.pdf), underpinning the metaverse as an important digital opportunity and trend while also setting out plans for potential regulations of the metaverse. However, the letter provides little specifics on EU actions. Another EU official, Thierry Breton, the Commissioner for Internal Market, wrote about the metaverse in a blog post. Breton [explained](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/european-commission-turns-its-gaze-towards-the-metaverse) that the metaverse was one of the European Commission\u2019s most pressing challenges, and its plan to foster the virtual world will focus on people, technologies, and infrastructure.\n\nEven though there is a broad debate about the metaverse in the US public, the government is keenly silent. The discussion of the metaverse is still in its early stage among politicians; a group of US representatives [established](https://delbene.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-delbene-clarke-flores-issa-and-lieu-form-reality-caucus) the Congressional Caucus on Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality Technologies to educate lawmakers and their staff on this emerging tech.\n\nThe metaverse and the underlying technologies could aid developing nations in closing economic and digital divides, for they provide a fresh start for everyone \u2013 venture into the unknown.\n\n* * *\n\n[According to a survey](https://www.ipsos.com/en/global-advisor-metaverse-extended-reality-may-2022) conducted by Ipsos for the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/05/countries-attitudes-metaverse-augmented-virtual-reality-davos22/) (WEF), enthusiasm for the metaverse and extended reality is highest in developing countries, while in developed (countries) not so much. Turkey was the country most familiar with the Metaverse at 86%, followed by India (80%), China (73%), and the higher-income country of South Korea (71%). At the same time, familiarity with (the metaverse) is lowest in Poland (27%), France (28%), Belgium (30%), and Germany (30%).\n\n## What are the opportunities of the metaverse?\n\nThe metaverse has numerous potential opportunities and benefits ranging from education, socialisation, safety, health and well-being, to accessibility and inclusion. _When discussing education, consider how COVID-19 changed remote learning; now, consider what the virtual world can be capable of._ The metaverse may be used to expand [learning options](https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-whole-new-world-education-meets-the-metaverse/) and provide students greater access than it might otherwise be possible in a physical environment, for example, by making the teaching material more vivid and visual. Within these 3D simulations, it is possible to participate in historical events, visualise geometrical elements, explore planets and much more. [The US army has revealed](https://www.wired.com/story/military-metaverse/) building its metaverse since this technology may be used to train (employees) for job readiness, particularly in high-risk industries. In healthcare, the virtual reality system is [already used](https://medicalgiving.stanford.edu/news/virtual-reality-system-helps-surgeons-reassures-patients.html) to train residents, assist surgeons in planning upcoming operations, and educate patients. It also helps surgeons in the operating room, by guiding them in a three-dimensional space and by providing data. On 16 November 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [authorised](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-marketing-virtual-reality-system-chronic-pain-reduction) the first VR product to be marketed to treat chronic pain. The metaverse is envisioned as a meeting place for individuals worldwide; therefore, it has the potential for increased socialisation.\n\nOn top of that, we can add socialisation during entertainment, such as rich immersive experiences with [concerts and movies in VR mode](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/entertainment/), [museum visits](https://fortune.com/2022/04/28/museums-history-gamification-nfts-metaverse-tech-art-yizan-he/), or travel. The nature of the metaverse can make digital content more [accessible](https://www.lifewire.com/making-the-metaverse-accessible-is-better-for-everyone-5218160) to everyone. As neurotechnology continues to progress, we may expect that it will provide more accessibility to millions of people who struggle to interact with digital content daily due to disability and impairments.\n\nSome **personal safety** measures that would not work in the actual world could be available in the metaverse. For example, users of Meta's \u2018Horizon Worlds\u2019, (VR game), may immediately enter a \u2018 [Safe Zone](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/horizon/explore-horizon-worlds/safe-zone-in-horizon/),\u2019 a protective bubble they can activate when they feel endangered.\n\n## What are the challenges of the metaverse?\n\n- About WordPress\n\n\n\n- [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/)\n- [Documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/)\n- [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/)\n- [Support](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/)\n- [Feedback](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/requests-and-feedback)\n\n- Search\n\n\n[Close menu](https://dig.watch/technologies/metaverse#page \"Close menu\")",

The focus was on hand-gesture control, offering a seamless, hands-free experience for interacting with digital content.\n\n[iframe](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynLm-QvsW0Q?feature=oembed)\n\nThe wearable augmented reality market estimates looked like a massive increase in sales and the buyouts of the market as analysts believed are rear-to-market figures standing at 114.5 billion US dollars in the year 2030. The Orion glasses are Meta\u2019s courageous and aggressive tilt towards this booming market segment.

Our team was thrilled to have a chance to attend this event, which showcased the latest in gaming and gave us a glimpse into the future of the industry. Gamescom 2024 was a record-breaking conference, with over 335,000 guests from about 120 nations, making it one of the world\u2019s largest and most international gaming gatherings. This year\u2019s showcase had a considerable rise in attendance \u2014 nearly 15,000 people over the previous year. Gamescom 2024 introduced new hardware advances used for the next generation of video games. Improvements in CPUs and video cards, particularly from big companies in the industry like AMD and NVIDIA, are pushing the boundaries of what is feasible for games in terms of performance and graphics. For example, NVIDIA introduced the forthcoming GeForce RTX series, which promises unprecedented levels of immersion and realism. Not to be outdone, AMD has introduced a new series of Ryzen processors designed to survive the most extreme gaming settings. These technological advancements are critical as they allow video game developers to create more complex and visually stunning games, particularly for virtual reality. As processing power increases, virtual reality is reaching new heights. We saw numerous VR-capable games at Gamescom that offer players an unparalleled level of immersion. Being a VR/AR development company, we were excited to watch how technology was evolving and what new possibilities it was bringing up. The video game called \u201cHalf-Life: Alyx\u201d has set a new standard, and it\u2019s clear that VR is no longer a niche but a growing segment of the gaming market. Gamescom\u2019s format proved its strength, as indicated by the fact that its two days were run in two formats. Gamescom stands out from other games exhibitions or conventions by being both a business and consumer show. This dual format enables the developers to collect feedback on their products immediately. This is especially so when meeting prospective clients during a presentation or when giving a demonstration to gamers, the response elicited is very helpful. Rarely does anyone get a chance to witness the actual implementation and real-world effect of what they have done.](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/gamescom-2024-the-future-of-gaming-is-here-and-its-bigger-than-ever/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%202400%201735%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/how-to-use-artificial-intelligence-in-creating-content-for-rpg-games/)\n\n[Devlog](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/devlog/)\n\nSeptember 2, 2024\n\n[How to Use Artificial Intelligence in Creating Content for RPG Games](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/how-to-use-artificial-intelligence-in-creating-content-for-rpg-games/)\n\n[Introduction The World of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Its Application in Content Creation for RPG Games Recently, the world of IT technology has been actively filled with various iterations of artificial intelligence. From advanced chatbots that provide technical support to complex algorithms aiding doctors in disease diagnosis, AI\u2019s presence is increasingly felt. In a few years, it might be hard to imagine our daily activities without artificial intelligence, especially in the IT sector. Let\u2019s focus on generative artificial intelligence, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others, which have long held an important place in software development. However, special attention should be given to the application of AI in the video game industry. We see AI being used from voice generation to real-time responses. Admittedly, this area is not yet so developed as to be widely implemented in commercially available games. But the main emphasis I want to make is on the creation and enhancement of game content using AI. In my opinion, this is the most promising and useful direction for game developers. The Lack of Resources in Creating Large and Ambitious RPG Games and How AI Can Be a Solution In the world of indie game development, a field with which I am closely familiar, the scarcity of resources, especially time and money, is always a foremost challenge. While artificial intelligence (AI) cannot yet generate money or add extra hours to the day (heh-heh), it can be the key to effectively addressing some of these issues. Realism here is crucial. We understand that AI cannot write an engaging story or develop unique gameplay mechanics \u2013 these aspects remain the domain of humans (yes, game designers and other creators can breathe easy for now). However, where AI can truly excel is in generating various items, enhancing ideas, writing coherent texts, correcting errors, and similar tasks. With such capabilities, AI can significantly boost the productivity of each member of an indie team, freeing up time for more creative and unique tasks, from content generation to quest structuring. What is Artificial Intelligence and How Can it be Used in Game Development For effective use of AI in game development, a deep understanding of its working principles is essential. Artificial intelligence is primarily based on complex mathematical models and algorithms that enable machines to learn, analyze data, and make decisions based on this data. This could be machine learning, where algorithms learn from data over time becoming more accurate and efficient, or deep learning, which uses neural networks to mimic the human brain. Let\u2019s examine the main types of AI Narrative AI (OpenAI ChatGPT, Google BERT): Capable of generating stories, dialogues, and scripts. Suitable for creating the foundations of the game world and dialogues. Analytical AI (IBM Watson, Palantir Technologies): Focuses on data collection and analysis. Used for optimizing game processes and balance. Creative AI (Adobe Photoshop\u2019s Neural Filters, Runway ML): Able to create visual content such as textures, character models, and environments. Generative AI (OpenAI DALL-E, GPT-3 and GPT-4 from OpenAI): Ideal for generating unique names, item descriptions, quest variability, and other content. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each type of AI, developers can use them more effectively in their work. For example, using AI to generate original stories or quests can be challenging, but using it for correcting grammatical errors or generating unique names and item descriptions is more realistic and beneficial. This allows content creators to focus on more creative aspects of development, optimizing their time and resources. An Overview of the Characteristics of Large Fantasy RPG Games and Their Content Requirements In large fantasy RPG games, not only gameplay and concept play a pivotal role, but also the richness and variability of content \u2013 spells, quests, items, etc. This diversity encourages players to immerse themselves in the game world, sometimes spending hundreds of hours exploring every nook and cranny. The quantity of this content is important, but so is its quality. Imagine, we offer the player a relic named \u201cGreat Heart\u201d with over 100 attribute variations \u2013 that\u2019s one approach. But if we offer 100 different relics, each with a unique name and 3-4 variations in description, the player\u2019s experience is significantly different. In AAA projects, the quality of content is usually high, with hundreds of thousands of hours invested in creating items, stories, and worlds. However, in the indie sector, the situation is different: there\u2019s a limited number of items, less variability \u2013 unless we talk about roguelikes, where world and item generation are used. A typical feature of roguelikes is the randomization of item attributes. However, they rarely offer unique generation of names or descriptions; if they do, it\u2019s more about applying formulas and substitution rules, rather than AI. This opens new possibilities for the use of artificial intelligence \u2013 not just as a means of generating random attributes, but also in creating deep, unique stories, characters, and worlds, adding a new dimension to games. Integrating AI for Item Generation: How AI Can Assist in Creating Unique Items (Clothing, Weapons, Consumables). One of the practical examples of using AI is creating variations based on existing criteria. Why do I consider this the best way to utilize AI? Firstly, having written the story of your game world, we can set limits for the AI, providing clear input and output data. This ensures a 100% predictable outcome from AI. Let\u2019s examine this more closely. When talking about the world\u2019s story, I mean a few pages that describe the world, its nature, and rules. It could be fantasy, sci-fi, with examples of names, unique terminology, or characteristic features that help AI understand the mood and specifics of the world. Here is an excerpt from the text I wrote for my game world. The Kingdom of Arteria is an ancient and mysterious realm, shrouded in secrets and imbued with a powerful form of dark magic. For centuries, it has been ruled by Arteon the First, a wise and just monarch whose benevolence has brought peace and prosperity to his\u2026](https://www.qualium-systems.com/blog/how-to-use-artificial-intelligence-in-creating-content-for-rpg-games/)\n\n#### Let's discuss your ideas\n\n[Contact us](/contact/)\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\n[AddToAny](https://www.addtoany.com \"Share Buttons\")\n\n[More\u2026](#addtoany \"Show all\")\n\n[iframe](https://static.addtoany.com/menu/sm.25.html#type=core&event=load)\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LcZY2MlAAAAAKvlcY4mmKQlY7bWXB7ow4ZAy1MW&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucXVhbGl1bS1zeXN0ZW1zLmNvbTo0NDM.&hl=en&v=zIriijn3uj5Vpknvt_LnfNbF&size=invisible&cb=48lqlaz50i6r)",

Zuckerberg announced that their main focus will be building the Metaverse. Since then, Metaverse has lived through a rise, when many startups aimed to be Metaverse pioneers, and a stagnation, when some companies pivoted towards AI as the new technological frontier, leaving the Metaverse behind. Even Meta itself faced significant challenges, with reports of massive [financial losses](https://qz.com/meta-metaverse-facebook-earnings-mark-zuckerberg-1851433524) due to its Metaverse investments. At the same time, the promised Metaverse, as Zuck described it in the very beginning, still needed to be delivered to the users.\n\nNevertheless, despite these setbacks, Zuckerberg still believes in the idea of the Metaverse. He acknowledges that developing such a digital ecosystem may take years if not decades. Thus, Meta continues to play a leading role in this field, as evidenced by its work on AR and VR technologies at Meta Connect 2024.\n\n## **What\u2019s new at Meta Connect 2024**\n\nMeta At the end of September, Meta Connect 2024 took place, where the company introduced several novel technologies related to augmented reality, virtual reality, and AI.\n\n### **Meet Orion**\n\nOne of the convention\u2019s most discussed innovations was the [Orion](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/) AR Glasses prototype. The AR glasses combine the familiar design of regular eyewear with advanced augmented reality features. Orion combines voice input, eye and hand tracking, and a novel EMG wristband to enable users to engage seamlessly with their surroundings.\n\n_\"We believe Orion is the most advanced AR glasses ever created,\"_ \\- Mark Zuckerberg\n\nAt the moment, Orion is not being available to the general public. AR glasses are presently exclusively available to Meta personnel and select users, with no clear schedule for commercial distribution.\n![Orion](https://i0.wp.com/adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/4.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\n\n### **Meta Quest 3S**\n\nAnother news announcement at Meta Connect is [Meta Quest 3S](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/meta-quest-3s-our-most-affordable-mixed-reality-headset/). This is a mixed-reality headset that will be available for pre-order on September 25 and will ship on October 15. With Meta Quest 3S, users can listen to music, make spreadsheets, play games with friends, and socialize. Zuckerberg underlined the device's versatility, stating:\n\n_\"This is what we're building: not the next gaming platform, but the next computing platform.\"_\n![Meta Quest 3S](https://i0.wp.com/adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/3.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\n\n### **Hyperscape**\n\n[Hyperscape](http://hyperscape/) is a technology that seeks to create realistic environments in the Metaverse. Hyperscape uses Gaussian Splatting, a volumetric 3D rendering technique, to generate realistic environments that make viewers feel physically present. This feature is currently in development, but it has the potential to change the way people interact with virtual environments.\n![Hyperscape](https://i0.wp.com/adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\n\n### **Meta AI**\n\n[Meta AI](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/metas-ai-product-news-connect/) also captured a lot of attention at the event. Zuckerberg made improvements to make the AI helper more adaptive and user-friendly. It is growing, with over 400 million monthly users and 185 million weekly users interacting with the AI across several platforms. Zuckerberg emphasized enhancements that enhance Meta AI's capabilities and make interactions more intuitive.\n\n_\"Meta AI can now see and talk,\"_ he said, referring to new voice features available on Messenger, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. The AI can respond to human questions orally and analyze images sent over chat, detecting objects and making adjustments as needed.\n\n### **Ray-Ban Meta**\n\nThis innovation was not a part of the Meta Connect 2024, but this recent case also represents Meta's vector towards VR/AR. The collaborations with Ray-Ban have resulted in some fantastic smart glasses.\n\n_\"With iconic style and the latest in wearable tech, you can capture and share your world with photos, a video call,_ or a live stream, listen to your favorite playlist, and make a call or text using voice commands \u2013 all from your smart glasses. The Meta View app allows you to view, share, and save the photos and videos that you capture from your smart glasses, customize voice controls, _and manage your settings.\"_ \\- From [Meta](https://www.meta.com/be/en/smart-glasses/) website\n![Ray-Ban Meta](https://i0.wp.com/adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)\n\n## **The future of VR, AR, and the Metaverse**\n\nThe VR market is rapidly expanding, expected to reach over [$22 billion](https://www.coolest-gadgets.com/vr-headset-statistics) by 2025. Speaking about Meta, the revenue from selling AR/VR glasses is [growing](https://www.uploadvr.com/metas-reality-labs-revenue-growth-q2-2024/) every year. One of the key reasons for the growing popularity of VR is its increasing affordability, making it accessible to a wider range of consumers. Devices like Meta Quest have been priced significantly lower than many high-end tech gadgets, opening the door for casual consumers, gamers, and even educational sectors to experiment with immersive experiences.\n\nIn contrast to VR, AR devices, despite having immense potential, are prohibitively expensive at their most. Thus, they are out of reach for regular consumers. Another problem with AR devices is the lack of audience for which they were designed.\n\nThe recent Apple\u2019s Vision Pro\u2019s starting price has exceeded $3,000. It\u2019s viewed more as a luxury product than a mass-market solution. Dr. Jonathan Reichental, in his article for [Forbes,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanreichental/2024/06/29/apples-vision-pro-is-amazing-but-no-one-wants-it/) claimed:\n\n_\"Not long after purchasing and overcoming the novelty factor, many users began pondering how they might use the device. This was compounded by the lack of Vision Pro-specific applications and media.\"_\n\nSimilarly, Google Glass, one of the first AR devices to be released, struggled with adoption, largely because of its steep price and unclear value proposition for everyday consumers. These pricing strategies have kept AR devices from achieving the same mainstream success as VR, limiting their impact and reach.\n\nSince access to Meta\u2019s Orion remains limited, questions arise about its future. First, will Meta be able to make this technology broadly available, or is it another long-term aim that may take years to achieve? Second, what will be the sale outcomes?\n\nVR/AR devices are considered the main devices that access the Metaverse. The availability and clear purpose of devices are the keys to increasing awareness and adoption of the Metaverse. If AR devices remain expensive, they will continue to be limited to niche markets, and their potential will remain unnoticed. Thus, the faster companies can bring these technologies to a larger audience, the quicker the Metaverse will grow and become a central part of our digital world.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?text=Meta+Connect+2024%3A+AR%2C+VR%2C+and+the+Future+of+the+Metaverse&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadello.com%2Fmeta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse%2F)[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fadello.com%2Fmeta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse%2F)[Email](mailto:?body=Here%20is%20the%20link%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fadello.com%2Fmeta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse%2F&subject=Check%20out%20this%20post%20-%20Meta%20Connect%202024:%20AR,%20VR,%20and%20the%20Future%20of%20the%20Metaverse)[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadello.com%2Fmeta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse%2F&title=Meta%20Connect%202024:%20AR,%20VR,%20and%20the%20Future%20of%20the%20Metaverse&summary=Check%20out%20this%20post%20-&source=Adello)\n\n[\u2190 Previous](https://adello.com/mobile-marketing-trends-in-2024-and-beyond/)\n\n[Next \u2192](https://adello.com/ready-set-sell-black-friday-is-coming/)\n\n### Leave a Reply[Cancel reply](https://adello.com/meta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse/\\#respond)\n\nPost a Comment\n\nLog in or provide your name and email to leave a comment.\n\nEmail me new posts\n\nInstantlyDailyWeekly\n\nEmail me new comments\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\nComment\n\n\u0394\n\n##### Recent news\n\n[![Adello.Direct-Blog-2](https://adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Adellos-Blog-images-7.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\n**The Biggest Influencer Scam of All Time - What Case with Honey Can Teach Us** \\\\\n\\\\\nJanuary 8, 2025](https://adello.com/the-biggest-influencer-scam-of-all-time-what-case-with-honey-can-teach-us/)\n\n[![Adello.Direct-Blog-2](https://adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Adellos-Blog-images-5.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\n**The Audience Doesn\u2019t Like AI-Generated Video Ads - NIQ Research States** \\\\\n\\\\\nJanuary 3, 2025](https://adello.com/the-audience-doesnt-like-ai-generated-video-ads-niq-research-states/)\n\n[![Adello.Direct-Blog-2](https://adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Web3 Marketing: Debunking Myths and Uncovering Truths** \\\\\n\\\\\nDecember 16, 2024](https://adello.com/web3-marketing-debunking-myths-and-uncovering-truths/)\n\n[![Adello.Direct-Blog-2](https://adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Adellos-Blog-images-1.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Why Black Friday is Mobile** \\\\\n\\\\\nNovember 20, 2024](https://adello.com/why-black-friday-is-mobile/)\n\n1 [2](https://adello.com/meta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse/page/2/) [3](https://adello.com/meta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse/page/3/)\u2026 [41](https://adello.com/meta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse/page/41/) [Next \u00bb](https://adello.com/meta-connect-2024-ar-vr-and-the-future-of-the-metaverse/page/2/)\n\n##### archive\n\n##### about us\n\n[Blog](https://adello.com/blog/) [Awards](https://adello.com/awards/) [Careers](https://adello.com/careers/) [Contact](https://adello.com/contact/) [Privacy Policy](https://adello.com/privacy-policy/) [Opt-out](https://adello.com/opt-out/) [Legal Terms](https://adello.com/legal-terms/)\n\n##### Mobile Advertising\n\n[Mobile Advertising](https://adello.com/mobile-advertising/) [Managed Service Products](https://adello.com/managed-service/) [Omnichannel Strategy](https://adello.com/omnichannel-strategy/) [Technology](https://adello.com/self-improving-campaigns/) [Creative Gallery](https://adello.com/creative-gallery/) [Solutions by Industry](https://adello.com/solutions-customer-success/) [Ad Glossary](https://adello.com/ad-glossary/)\n\n##### connect\n\n##### subscribe\n\n##### membership\n\n![](https://adello.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Adello-Memberships.jpg) [Request Demo](https://adello.com/request-call-with-adello/)\n\nCopyright 2008 - 2023 \u00a9 Adello\n\nUSA\n\nSwitzerland\n\nGermany\n\nNetherlands\n\nSingapore\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The company soon opened its play universe called [Horizon Worlds](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/facebook-opens-horizon-worlds-vr-metaverse-app-.html), featuring floating personalized avatars.\n\nAs the rebranding to Meta approaches its third anniversary, none of that stuff has gone mainstream.\n\nBut the company appears to have found its footing in virtual and augmented reality through a different medium.\n\nAfter achieving surprise early success in the smart glasses market through a [partnership](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/17/facebook-enlists-ray-ban-maker-luxottica-to-make-orion-ar-glasses.html) with Ray-Ban, Meta is ginning up excitement for the prototype of a much more advanced pair of glasses called Orion, a project nearly a decade in the making. Zuckerberg\u2019s [reveal of Orion](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/meta-unveils-cheaper-299-quest-3s-vr-headset-.html) late last month has triggered a level of enthusiasm that\u2019s unfamiliar in the metaverse.\n\nThe triumphant demo, at Meta\u2019s annual Connect event, was a relief to many employees and represented an internal shift in sentiment toward Zuckerberg\u2019s costly hardware ambitions, according to people close to the company who asked not to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the press on the matter.\n\nAt the start of the demo, Zuckerberg pulled the device out of a locked metal briefcase. He showed off the gadget \u2014 a pair of black, thick-framed AR glasses \u2014 to the live audience before placing it on his face. Orion comes with a wireless puck that allows it to run holographic virtual images on top of what users see in real life. It also relies on a wristband that picks up on a user\u2019s neural signals to let them control the device.\n\nThe demo was seamless. The crowd oohed and aahed. Rave product reviews followed from the few who got to test it. CNBC\u2019s [Julia Boorstin described](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/hands-on-with-metas-orion-augmented-reality-smart-glasses-prototype.html) a call she had with her producer, saying, \u201cIt was like I was FaceTiming with him but he was in my glasses.\u201d The Verge\u2019s Alex Heath played Zuckerberg in a game of Pong and [wrote](https://www.theverge.com/24253908/meta-orion-ar-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg-interview) that he \u201cnoticed little to no lag in the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right way to look at Orion is as a time machine,\u201d Zuckerberg said at Connect. \u201cThese glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\u201d\n\n![Meta's Orion AR glasses prototype: CNBC reviews](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108041727-Meta_Orion_Glasses.jpg?v=1727811906&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:3102:31\n\nMeta\u2019s Orion AR glasses prototype: CNBC reviews\n\n[News Videos](https://www.cnbc.com/news-videos/)\n\nFollowing the Orion showcase, Meta is preparing to strengthen its relationship with software developers as it works toward building a consumer version of the device, and to pushing its current generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to more consumers for the 2024 holiday shopping season.\n\nThe company is also looking at ways to bring the technology developed for the Orion wristband to its other consumer devices, notably the Quest VR headsets and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nFor Meta, the uptick in excitement among employees and users comes well after Wall Street jumped back into the stock. After the company [lost almost two-thirds of its value](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/facebook-scrambles-to-escape-death-spiral-as-users-flee-sales-drop.html) in 2022 and then slashed about a [quarter of its workforce](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/19/meta-started-latest-round-of-layoffs-focusing-on-technical-employees.html), or 21,000 jobs, Meta\u2019s stock price almost tripled last year and is up more than 60% in 2024, reaching a fresh high this month.\n\nMeta proved the resilience of its dominant online advertising business, rebuilding the underlying technology after [Apple\u2019s](/quotes/AAPL/) iOS privacy change made it harder to target users, and [adding generative artificial intelligence tools](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html) to make it easier for brands to run campaigns.\n\nBut proving that it can mimic its digital ad success in a totally different market has been a persistent challenge.\n\nFacebook\u2019s initial foray into VR came in 2014 with the $2 billion [purchase of Oculus](https://about.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/). Since then, the company has poured more than $63 billion into what\u2019s now called Reality Labs, its AR and VR hardware and software division, and it\u2019s recording operating losses in the [billions of dollars per quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/metas-reality-labs-posts-4point5-billion-loss-in-second-quarter.html).\n\nIn the second quarter, Reality Labs generated just $353 million in revenue, accounting for less than 1% of the company\u2019s total sales. Industrywide, global shipments of VR and AR headsets in the period [sank](https://www.idc.com/promo/arvr) roughly 28% from a year earlier to 1.1 million units, according to market researcher IDC.\n\n\u201cThis is a very long-term bet,\u201d Zuckerberg said in July 2023. \u201cAt a deep level, I understand the discomfort that a lot of investors have with it because it\u2019s just outside of the model of I think even most long-term investors.\u201d\n\nOrion provides a tangible example of the company\u2019s strategy and a logical and compelling next step following smart glasses, people familiar with Reality Labs told CNBC.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\n\n## A project 10 years in the making\n\nMeta is planning to start courting developers next year, as it tries to get them excited about building apps for Orion so the company can learn what might resonate with consumers, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s road map.\n\nThe push into the developer community would coincide with Meta\u2019s expected debut of the fourth generation of its [Llama family](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/23/meta-debuts-newest-llama-ai-model-with-help-from-nvidia-and-others.html) of AI models. By releasing a more powerful Llama, Meta is hoping that developers would be able to incorporate the software in their future AR apps to help power tasks like recognizing real-world objects and more accurately reacting to voice commands, the people said.\n\nUltimately, Meta is working toward building a consumer version of Orion, something that could happen within two years, they said.\n\nThat timeline may be overly ambitious considering how long it took to get Orion this far.\n\nFacebook began working on the device as far back as 2016 under the leadership of Oculus\u2019 then chief scientist, [Michael Abrash](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/introducing-michael-abrash-oculus-chief-scientist/), according to people familiar with the matter. Abrash is now chief scientist at Reality Labs.\n\n![Meta employee Sara Nicholson poses with the Ray-Ban sunglasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 24, 2024.

For example, visuals didn\u2019t work outdoors, they said.\n\nMeta has been testing functioning versions of Orion glasses for well over two years, the people said, getting the product to a point where it could finally be unveiled to the broader company and to outsiders. The company finished the prototype in March. Engineers put a lot of work into getting the device to weigh less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces), about twice the weight of a heavy pair of glasses, and to have a 70-degree field of view, sources said.\n\nZuckerberg, who\u2019s been the driving force behind the company\u2019s advances in AR and VR, made the ultimate decision to go public with Orion, the people said.\n\n## Building on surprise success\n\nMeta is likely years away from being able to deliver a consumer version of Orion and has numerous challenges to overcome to reach mass production.\n\n\u201cOne could criticize Orion as vaporware,\u201d Joseph Bonner, an analyst at Argus Research, wrote in a report to clients on Oct. 4, referring to \u201ctechnology that may not end up in an actual product.\u201d Bonner, who recommends buying the stock, said the product demonstrates \u201cMeta\u2019s continued commitment to virtual and mixed reality applications.\u201d\n\nMeta will need to develop a global manufacturing supply chain that can account for some of the rare materials used in the device. One particular hurdle will be figuring out how to get mass quantities of silicon carbide, which is used for the displays in the Orion lenses.\n\nMeta recently hired someone from semiconductor contract manufacturing company [GlobalFoundries](/quotes/GFS/) to help develop and oversee the supply chain for Orion and related AR and VR devices, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nIn the meantime, Meta is looking to build on the success of its second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nReleased in partnership with [EssilorLuxottica](/quotes/EL-FR/) in September of last year, the product featured a number of upgrades, including better camera quality, improved battery life and an AI voice assistant.\n\nThe smart glasses went viral on TikTok during the holiday shopping season, and sales exceeded both companies\u2019 expectations. More than 730,000 units have been sold in their first three quarters since release, according to IDC. Zuckerberg told investors in July that they were \u201ca bigger hit sooner than expected.\u201d\n\nLast month, Meta and Luxottica agreed to extend their partnership, with plans to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nA Luxottica representative didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeta is also opening a [pop-up shop](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-meta-glasses-collection-news-updates-connect-2024/) to showcase the smart glasses and to get them in front of more consumers.\n\nThe pop-up shop will be at a retail space in Los Angeles.

However, companies had already been making strides in the space for several years, and the tech giant\u2019s announcement only signalled the huge momentum built around this innovative concept.\n\nA combination of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality, blockchain, and other technologies, the Metaverse aims to give users a rich, all-encompassing experience of a simulated virtual world that\u2014according to most companies working in the space\u2014is soon going to replicate every aspect of real life. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to feel present \u2013 like we\u2019re right there with people no matter how far apart we actually are\u201d said Mark Zuckerberg, per [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/28/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-meta-metaverse), during his announcement of the imminent rebranding.\n\nNeedless to say that demand for virtual and immersive experiences has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, kickstarting the sector\u2019s explosive growth. According to [Precedence Research](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/metaverse-market), the global metaverse market size was valued at $92.46bn in 2023 and it is estimated to surpass around $2.38tn by 2033 with a registered CAGR of 38.31%.\n\n### Subscribe to the Founder\u2019s Bulletin\n\nJoin our community of 4,000 + Founders, Entrepreneurs & Advisors.\n\nGet news, advice, and valuation multiples reports like this one straight into your inbox.\n\nEmail:\n\nBy submitting this form I give permission for Finerva to contact me.\n[Privacy policy.](https://finerva.com/privacy-policy/)\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\nInvestors\u2019 and large companies\u2019 interest in the Metaverse space is palpable. Only a few weeks after Meta\u2019s announcement, [Nike partnered](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/nike-teams-up-with-roblox-to-create-a-virtual-world-called-nikeland-.html) with online gaming studio and Metaverse pioneer Roblox\u2014which went public at the stellar valuation of [$39bn](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/roblox-ipo-trading-begins-online-gaming-value-29-billion-rblx/) in March 2021\u2014to create Nikeland, an virtual world where users can dress up their avatars in Nike-branded sneakers and apparel.\n\nIn May 2022 VC firm Andreessen-Horowitz\u2014who were already advocating for the disruptive tech back in [2020](https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-metaverse/)\u2014announced a [$600m fund](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/andreessen-horowitz-gaming-fund-metaverse) dedicated to Metaverse, VR and Web3 projects. Within a week from the fund launch, world-class VC Sequoia capital poured $37m into Singapore-based [Metaverse start-up BUD](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaydecheung/2022/05/23/sequoia-leads-37-million-series-b-funding-round-in-singapore-metaverse-startup/).\n\nThe up-and-coming sector wasn\u2019t spared from [criticism](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/metaverse-outlook-overhyped-regulations-facebook-meta-virtual-worlds-genz-2021-12) that the technology is overhyped and will face a regulatory nightmare over every aspect\u2014from transactions and currencies to hate speech, and was dragged down by the fall of adjacent sectors such as crypto and [Web3](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/blockchain-web3-dead.html).\n\nThe [GlobalX VR & Metavers ETF](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/vr/) (VR), managed by [Mirae Asset Financial Group](https://www.miraeassetmf.co.in/), invests in companies \u201ciinvolved in the development of hardware and software that allow users to experience extended digital realities, creator platforms, where live streaming and other media content is shared in 3D simulations; creator economies, involving the development of applications involving digital payments\u2026\u201d as well as adjacent sectors like [blockchain](https://finerva.com/report/blockchain-crypto-2022-valuation-multiples/) and cloud computing.\n\nOf the 30 companies in the index, about 30 have their profit and revenue publicly available. While this is a relatively small sample in terms of statistical significance, it is still relevant in terms of understanding trends in investor sentiment, as well as as a benchmark for [private companies](https://finerva.com/multiples-valuations/).\n\n## Metaverse & Virtual Reality Tech Valuation Multiples\n\nMetaverse companies that were already publicly listed in Q1 2020 were valued at 4.1x their Revenue. Throughout the pandemic the median revenue multiple for the sector kept rising, up to 6.7x in Q4 2021.\n\nThe sector has since seen a sharp decline following broader trends in the market and the post-pandemic capital shortage. Multiples for the sector have been looking healthy throughout all of last year: **in Q4 2023 the median EV/Revenue multiple for Metaverse companies was 4.4x**, slightly above pre-pandemic levels.\n\n_Source:_ [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/companies/VR/holdings)\n\nResults across the cohort became distinctly more right-skewed over the course of the past two years, with the top-25% performers in the cohort achieving multiples between 7x and 27x in Q4 2023.\n\n_Source: [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/companies/VR/holdings)_ _In the chart above, the lines indicate the range of EV/Revenue multiples in our cohorts, while the boxes highlight the Interquartile Range (IQR), which is where the median 50% of the cohort ranks based on their valuation multiple._\n\nMedian EV/EBITDA multiples went from 13.4x to 21.7x throughout 2020, before falling in 2021\u2014although less than their Revenue counterparts. **In Q4 2023 the Median EV/EBITDA Multiple for Multiverse companies was 11x.**\n\n_Source:_ [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/companies/VR/holdings)\n\nEBITDA Multiples show how profitable companies are particularly valuable in a space that is still finding its way towards money-making business models.

We probably learned as much about this product space from a few months of real-life demos than we did from the years of work it took to make them. There is just no substitute for actually building something, putting it in people\u2019s hands and learning from how they react to it.\n\nOrion wasn\u2019t our only example of that this year. Our [mixed reality hardware](https://www.meta.com/quest/) and [AI glasses](https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses) have both reached a new level of quality and accessibility. The stability of those platforms allows our software developers to move much faster on everything from operating systems to new AI features. This is how I see the metaverse starting to come into greater focus and why I\u2019m so confident that the coming year will be the most important one in the history of Reality Labs.\n\n**2024 was the year AI glasses hit their stride.** When we first started making smart glasses in 2021 we thought they could be a nice first step toward the AR glasses we eventually wanted to build. While mixed reality headsets are on track to becoming a general purpose computing platform much like today\u2019s PCs, we saw glasses as the natural evolution of today\u2019s mobile computing platforms. So we wanted to begin learning from the real world as soon as possible.\n\nThe biggest thing we\u2019ve learned is that glasses are by far the best form factor for a truly AI-native device. In fact they might be the first hardware category to be completely defined by AI from the beginning. For many people, glasses are the place where an AI assistant makes the most sense, especially when it\u2019s a [multimodal system](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-meta-glasses-collection-news-updates-connect-2024/) that can truly understand the world around you.\n\nWe\u2019re right at the beginning of the S-curve for this entire product category, and there are endless opportunities ahead. One of the things I\u2019m most excited about for 2025 is the evolution of AI assistants into tools that don\u2019t just respond to a prompt when you ask for help but can become a proactive helper as you go about your day. At Connect we showed how Live AI on glasses can become more of a real-time participant when you\u2019re getting things done. As this feature [begins rolling out in early access this month](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-meta-v11-software-update-live-ai-translation-shazam/) we\u2019ll see the first step toward a new kind of personalized AI assistant.\n\nIt won\u2019t be the last. We\u2019re currently in the middle of an industry-wide push to make AI-native hardware. You\u2019re seeing phone and PC makers scramble to rebuild their products to put AI assistants at their core. But I think a much bigger opportunity is to make devices that are AI-native from the start, and I\u2019m confident that glasses are going to be the first to get there. Meta\u2019s Chief Research Scientist Michael Abrash has been talking about the potential of a personalized, context-aware AI assistant on glasses [for many years](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/inventing-the-future/), and building the technologies that make it possible has been a huge focus of our research teams.\n\n**Mixed reality** has been another place where having the right product in the hands of a lot of people has been a major accelerant for progress. We\u2019ve seen [Meta Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/) get better month after month as we continue to iterate on the core system passthrough, multitasking, spatial user interfaces and more. All these gains extended to [Quest 3S](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/) the moment it launched. This meant the $299 Quest 3S was in many respects a better headset on day 1 than the $499 Quest 3 was when it first launched in 2023. And the entire Quest 3 family keeps getting better with [every update](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-v72-update-remote-desktop-hand-tracking-keyboard-more).\n\nIn 2025 we\u2019ll see the next iteration of this as Quest 3S brings a lot more people into mixed reality for the first time. While Quest 3 has been a hit among people excited to own the very best device on the market, we\u2019re seeing that Quest 3S is [our most giftable headset](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/why-you-should-buy-a-quest/) yet. Sales were strong over the Black Friday weekend, and we\u2019re expecting a surge of people activating their new headsets over the holiday break.\n\nThis will continue a trend that took shape over the last year: growth in new users who are seeking out a wider range of things to do with their headsets. We want these new users to see the magic of MR and stick around for the long run, which is why we\u2019re funding developers to build the new types of apps and games they\u2019re looking for.\n\nThere\u2019s been a significant influx of younger people in particular, and they have been gravitating toward social and competitive multiplayer games, as well as freemium content. And titles like [_Skydance\u2019s BEHEMOTH_](https://www.meta.com/experiences/skydances-behemoth/5767635983306831/), [_Batman: Arkham Shadow_](https://www.meta.com/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/) (which just won Best AR/VR game at The Game Awards!), and [_Metro Awakening_](https://www.meta.com/experiences/metro-awakening/5096918017089406/) showed once again that some of the best new games our industry produces are now only possible on today\u2019s headsets.\n\nAs the number of people in MR grows, the quality of the social experience it can deliver is growing in tandem. This is at the heart of what Meta is trying to achieve with Reality Labs and where the greatest potential of the metaverse will be unlocked: \u201cthe chance to create the most social platform ever\u201d is how we described it when we [first began working on it](https://about.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/). We took two steps forward on this front in 2024: first with a broad set of improvements to Horizon Worlds including its expansion to mobile, and second with the next-generation Meta Avatars system that lets people represent themselves across our apps and headsets. And as the visual quality and overall experience with these systems improve, more people are getting their first glimpse of a social metaverse. We\u2019re seeing similar trends with new Quest 3S users spending more time in Horizon Worlds, making it a Top 3 immersive app for Quest 3S, and people continue creating new Meta Avatars across mobile and MR.\n\nGetting mixed reality into the mainstream has helped illuminate what will come next. One of the first trends that we discovered after the launch of Quest 3 last year was people using mixed reality to watch videos while multitasking in their home\u2014doing the dishes or vacuuming their living rooms. This was an early signal that people love having a big virtual screen that you can take anywhere and place in the physical world around you. We\u2019ve seen that trend take off with all sorts of entertainment experiences growing fast across the whole Quest 3 family. [New features like YouTube Co-Watch](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/youtube-co-watch-party-vr-mixed-reality/?srsltid=AfmBOoraQ4rAYD0N9z0RUXuavBaqGOgr49RGTlpHmrWDAHa-xcy6evSO) show how much potential there is for a whole new kind of social entertainment experience in the metaverse.\n\nThat\u2019s why James Cameron, one the most technologically innovative storytellers of our lifetimes, is now working to help more filmmakers and creators [produce great 3D content for Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/james-cameron-lightstorm-vision-partnership/). While 3D films have been produced for decades, there\u2019s never been a way to view them that\u2019s quite as good as an MR headset, and next year more people will own a headset than ever before. \u201cWe\u2019re at a true, historic inflection point, _\u201d_ [Jim said](https://www.threads.net/@jamescameronofficial/post/DDNPBvgS8wo?xmt=AQGzo-jHEFO2bxyYwH6Nk8AZBzT8uCWQas-tvn5S9D6OYw) when we [launched our new partnership](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/james-cameron-lightstorm-vision-partnership) this month.\n\nThis is happening alongside a larger shift Mark Rabkin [shared at Connect this year](https://developers.facebook.com/m/meta-connect-developer-sessions/developer-keynote/): Our vision for Horizon OS is to build a new kind of general purpose computing platform capable of running every kind of software, supporting every kind of user, and open to every kind of creator and developer. Our recent releases for 2D/3D multi-tasking, panel positioning, better hand tracking, Windows Remote Desktop integration and Open Store have started to build momentum along this new path. Horizon OS is on track to be the first platform that supports the full spectrum of experiences from immersive VR to 2D screens, mobile apps and virtual desktops \u2013 and the developer community is central to that success.\n\n**The next big step toward the metaverse** will be combining AI glasses with the kind of true augmented reality experience we revealed this year with Orion. It\u2019s not often that you get a glimpse of the future and see a totally new technology that shows you where things are heading. The people who saw Orion immediately understood what it meant for the future much like the people who saw first personal computers taking shape at Xerox PARC in the 1970s (\u201cwithin ten minutes it was obvious to me that all computers would work like this someday,\u201d Steve Jobs later said of his 1979 demo of the Xerox Alto).\n\nBeing able to put people in a time machine and show them how the next computing platform will look was a highlight of 2024 \u2013 and of my career so far. But the real impact of Orion will be in the products we ship next and the ways it helps us better understand what people love about AR glasses and what needs to get better. We spent years working on user research, product planning exercises, and experimental studies trying to understand how AR glasses should work, and that work is what enabled us to build Orion. But the pace of progress will be much more rapid from here on out now that we have a real product to build our intuition around.\n\nThis has been the lesson time and again [over the last decade at Reality Labs](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/reality-labs-10-year-anniversary-next-computing-platform-vr-mr-ar-xr/). The most important thing you can do when you\u2019re trying to invent the future is to ship things and learn from how real people use them. They won\u2019t always be immediate smash hits, but they\u2019ll always teach you something. And when you land on things that really hit the mark, like mixed reality on Quest 3 or AI on glasses, that\u2019s when you put your foot on the gas. This is what will make 2025 such a special year: With the right devices on the market, people experiencing them for the first time and developers discovering all the opportunities ahead, it\u2019s time to accelerate.\n\n* * *\n\nCategories\n\n:\n\n[Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technologies/meta/ )[Technology and Innovation](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technology-and-innovation/ )\n\nTags:\n\n[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/)[Augmented Reality](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/augmented-reality/)[Virtual Reality](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/virtual-reality/)\n\n* * *\n\n## Related News\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

recommendations](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#content4)\n\n* * *\n\n### The 2023 picture \u2013 META\n\nThe first half of this year has seen META consumers returning to increased level of spending for Consumer Tech & Durables (T&D) \u2013 especially domestic appliances.\n\nAfter the sharp growth in sales for META\u2019s T&D market in 2020 and 2021, last year\u2019s revenue stayed flat. However, the first six months this year have seen a +4% increase in revenue compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nPurchases of domestic appliances have led this positive bound, driven by new markets opening in the Middle East, and inflationary restrictions in Turkey and South Africa driving a change in consumers\u2019 willingness to buy. Sales revenue has been especially strong for small domestic appliances, growing +41% in January to June this year compared to the same period last year.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-1.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## Product innovation\n\nDisruption driven by launches of products offering dramatic innovation has been low this year. This means that META\u2019s consumers have often not always seeing a persuasive reason to buy the latest, newly launched products in certain categories, rather than buying an older model. Across TVs, tablets and some home appliances, models launched two or more years ago make up the same share of purchases as we were seeing in 2019. An exception is smartphones, where new models have taken a greater share in Q1 this year compared to Q1 2019.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-2.png?w=1024)\n\nWhile significant discounts obviously impact retailers\u2019 margins, promotional activities seen across META so far this year are approaching levels last seen in 2019. These events are motivating consumers to open their wallets, and we expect similar promotions will be crucial to trigger volume demand in the remainder of 2023.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-3.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## What factors will drive consumer spend in 2024+?\n\n1\\. Product lifetime costs\n\n- [1\\. Product lifetime costs](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#niq-tab-0 \"1.

Environment and sustainability](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#niq-tab-3 \"4. Environment and sustainability\")\n\nAs well as price, shoppers are also considering a product\u2019s operational costs across its full lifetime \u2013 it\u2019s durability, repairability, energy use. The crucial question is: which factor takes the lead at point of purchase?\n\n- 41% of panel TV buyers globally say \u201cdurability\u201d is an important aspect in making product choice \u2013 up 14 pp in two years.\n- 41% of consumers in META bought energy-saving products to save money in the long run\n\nSource: gfknewron Consumer 2023 & GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\nRobotic, multifunctional, smart, and cordless products that are easy to use and make lives more convenient continue to outperform the category average. Opportunities lie in products offering AI-controlled energy saving.\n\n- 57% in META say \u201cI really like the idea of technology that \u2018knows\u2019 me and can make recommendations and take actions based on my wants and needs\u201d\n- 49% in META are prepared to pay more for products that make their life easier\n\nSource: GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\nAspirational design continues to drive purchases, but \u201csolutions looking for a problem\u201d are out. People are keeping their \u2018treat myself\u2019 spend for products designed specifically for them as an individual. Examples can be seen across gaming, digital content creation, photography, gardening, and more.\n\n- 46% in META say \u201cIt is important to indulge or pamper myself on a regular basis\u201d\n- 54% in META say \u201cI like to buy products that can be tailored to my needs.\u201d\n\nSource: GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\n70% of people in META see \u201cGlobal climate change / global warming\u201d as a very or extremely serious issue. This affects consumer spending in two ways:\n\n- **Needs-based purchases** to combat climate effects: electric fans, air purifiers, air conditioners\n- **Values-based purchases** that support products and brands that are eco-friendly.\n\nConsumers\u2019 expectations here are expanding. In order to be perceived as genuinely eco-friendly, manufacturers and retailers need to be able to point to everything from the suppliers they work with; to their products\u2019 material, packaging, transportation, durability, recyclability; to their support of environmental or humanitarian causes.\n\nThis is a natural expansion of what we are already seeing at product level. In the EU5\u2019s highly competitive smartphone, mobile and phablet market, two-thirds of sales revenue in January to June this year came from products that have 3 or more eco-claims. With a growth rate of +22%, these items are substantially out-performing the rest.\n\n* * *\n\n## Planning for 2024+ global recommendations\n\n**How do manufacturers and retailers capitalize on the consumer trends above to shape an ambitious but sustainable strategic plan and budget allocation for 2024+?**\n\nWith budget planning for 2024 in full swing, these are our global recommendations on how to drive growth over the next few years. The local market and consumer landscape set out above will drive how best these are implemented at regional and country level.\n\n01\n\n#### Invest in targeted innovation (product & service)\n\nInnovation continues to appeal but must deliver value that is directly relevant to the consumer\u2019s life. Develop targeted, consumer-centric use-cases that show the benefits of upgrading to \u2018affordable premium\u2019 models.\n\n02\n\n#### Build up your brand to be a differentiator, as well as your product\n\nThe emotional connection between consumers and a brand plays a crucial role in competitive markets. Balance tactical activity with long-term, upper-funnel brand marketing that allows you to differentiate based on brand, rather than product or pricing alone.\n\n03\n\n#### Intensify manufacturer-retailer collaboration to optimize omnichannel category management\n\nBy teaming up to deliver consumer-centric planning that is unified across their respective merchandising, marketing, and supply chains, manufacturers and their retailers can optimise their mutual goal of creating a consistently personalised and enjoyable product experience at every touchpoint.\n\n04\n\n#### Planning for the upcoming shopper generation:\n\nGen Z will soon surpass millennials in size. Two-thirds are aged 15-24 and starting to frame opinions about brands. They consume 53% more content than the average but spend 50% less time on content than millennials. Like any generation, they include complex segments with differing demands.\n\n05\n\n#### Review regional and category footprint to capitalize regional growth opportunities and mitigate individual category risks\n\nEach region has unique market, category, and consumer dynamics.

recommendations](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#content4)\n\n* * *\n\n### The 2023 picture \u2013 META\n\nThe first half of this year has seen META consumers returning to increased level of spending for Consumer Tech & Durables (T&D) \u2013 especially domestic appliances.\n\nAfter the sharp growth in sales for META\u2019s T&D market in 2020 and 2021, last year\u2019s revenue stayed flat. However, the first six months this year have seen a +4% increase in revenue compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nPurchases of domestic appliances have led this positive bound, driven by new markets opening in the Middle East, and inflationary restrictions in Turkey and South Africa driving a change in consumers\u2019 willingness to buy. Sales revenue has been especially strong for small domestic appliances, growing +41% in January to June this year compared to the same period last year.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-1.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## Product innovation\n\nDisruption driven by launches of products offering dramatic innovation has been low this year. This means that META\u2019s consumers have often not always seeing a persuasive reason to buy the latest, newly launched products in certain categories, rather than buying an older model. Across TVs, tablets and some home appliances, models launched two or more years ago make up the same share of purchases as we were seeing in 2019. An exception is smartphones, where new models have taken a greater share in Q1 this year compared to Q1 2019.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-2.png?w=1024)\n\nWhile significant discounts obviously impact retailers\u2019 margins, promotional activities seen across META so far this year are approaching levels last seen in 2019. These events are motivating consumers to open their wallets, and we expect similar promotions will be crucial to trigger volume demand in the remainder of 2023.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-3.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## What factors will drive consumer spend in 2024+?\n\n1\\. Product lifetime costs\n\n- [1\\. Product lifetime costs](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#niq-tab-0 \"1.

Environment and sustainability](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#niq-tab-3 \"4. Environment and sustainability\")\n\nAs well as price, shoppers are also considering a product\u2019s operational costs across its full lifetime \u2013 it\u2019s durability, repairability, energy use. The crucial question is: which factor takes the lead at point of purchase?\n\n- 41% of panel TV buyers globally say \u201cdurability\u201d is an important aspect in making product choice \u2013 up 14 pp in two years.\n- 41% of consumers in META bought energy-saving products to save money in the long run\n\nSource: gfknewron Consumer 2023 & GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\nRobotic, multifunctional, smart, and cordless products that are easy to use and make lives more convenient continue to outperform the category average. Opportunities lie in products offering AI-controlled energy saving.\n\n- 57% in META say \u201cI really like the idea of technology that \u2018knows\u2019 me and can make recommendations and take actions based on my wants and needs\u201d\n- 49% in META are prepared to pay more for products that make their life easier\n\nSource: GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\nAspirational design continues to drive purchases, but \u201csolutions looking for a problem\u201d are out. People are keeping their \u2018treat myself\u2019 spend for products designed specifically for them as an individual. Examples can be seen across gaming, digital content creation, photography, gardening, and more.\n\n- 46% in META say \u201cIt is important to indulge or pamper myself on a regular basis\u201d\n- 54% in META say \u201cI like to buy products that can be tailored to my needs.\u201d\n\nSource: GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\n70% of people in META see \u201cGlobal climate change / global warming\u201d as a very or extremely serious issue. This affects consumer spending in two ways:\n\n- **Needs-based purchases** to combat climate effects: electric fans, air purifiers, air conditioners\n- **Values-based purchases** that support products and brands that are eco-friendly.\n\nConsumers\u2019 expectations here are expanding. In order to be perceived as genuinely eco-friendly, manufacturers and retailers need to be able to point to everything from the suppliers they work with; to their products\u2019 material, packaging, transportation, durability, recyclability; to their support of environmental or humanitarian causes.\n\nThis is a natural expansion of what we are already seeing at product level. In the EU5\u2019s highly competitive smartphone, mobile and phablet market, two-thirds of sales revenue in January to June this year came from products that have 3 or more eco-claims. With a growth rate of +22%, these items are substantially out-performing the rest.\n\n* * *\n\n## Planning for 2024+ global recommendations\n\n**How do manufacturers and retailers capitalize on the consumer trends above to shape an ambitious but sustainable strategic plan and budget allocation for 2024+?**\n\nWith budget planning for 2024 in full swing, these are our global recommendations on how to drive growth over the next few years. The local market and consumer landscape set out above will drive how best these are implemented at regional and country level.\n\n01\n\n#### Invest in targeted innovation (product & service)\n\nInnovation continues to appeal but must deliver value that is directly relevant to the consumer\u2019s life. Develop targeted, consumer-centric use-cases that show the benefits of upgrading to \u2018affordable premium\u2019 models.\n\n02\n\n#### Build up your brand to be a differentiator, as well as your product\n\nThe emotional connection between consumers and a brand plays a crucial role in competitive markets. Balance tactical activity with long-term, upper-funnel brand marketing that allows you to differentiate based on brand, rather than product or pricing alone.\n\n03\n\n#### Intensify manufacturer-retailer collaboration to optimize omnichannel category management\n\nBy teaming up to deliver consumer-centric planning that is unified across their respective merchandising, marketing, and supply chains, manufacturers and their retailers can optimise their mutual goal of creating a consistently personalised and enjoyable product experience at every touchpoint.\n\n04\n\n#### Planning for the upcoming shopper generation:\n\nGen Z will soon surpass millennials in size. Two-thirds are aged 15-24 and starting to frame opinions about brands. They consume 53% more content than the average but spend 50% less time on content than millennials. Like any generation, they include complex segments with differing demands.\n\n05\n\n#### Review regional and category footprint to capitalize regional growth opportunities and mitigate individual category risks\n\nEach region has unique market, category, and consumer dynamics. Manufacturers and retailers must have a full view across all regions and categories, and map this against their own portfolio, to pinpoint where growth opportunities exist for their products.\n\n## Mega-trends shaping T&D sales in 2024+\n\nGet your free copy of the report now\n\n[Download the full report](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#)\n\n##### Related content\n\n[![2025 will see Tech & Durables back to growth: NIQ full-year sales estimate\u00a0](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/GettyImages-1339801320-1200x800-5b2df79-2.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2025/2025-will-see-tech-durables-back-to-growth-niq-full-year-estimate/)[![Elevating business decision-making](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/Hama-case.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/success-story/2024/hama-elevating-business-decision-making/)[![Monitoring a market in motion](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/ANVR.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/success-story/2024/anvr-elevating-business-decision-making/)[![Early lessons from Cyber Monday 2024](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/GettyImages-103919691-1200x800-5b2df79.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/early-lessons-from-cyber-monday-2024/)",

Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have entered in major financial markets worldwide. As the completion of the US election, sovereign states and large institutions are building strategic reserves of Bitcoin, and accelerating their involvement in the digital currency industry. Consequently, Bitcoin has officially entered a new era of $100,000 per coin...\n\nSimilarly, in the past year, MetaEra, a Hong Kong-based media and market consulting service agency specializing in Web3.0, has emerged as a standout star in the industry. With an impressive tenfold business growth rate, skyrocketing traffic figures, and significant brand impact, MetaEra has captured the attention of the market. Leveraging its seamless global business operation capabilities covering the Asia-Pacific and North American regions, it has become the most dazzling supernova in the market.\n\n**Numbers in 2024: Tenfold business growth, traffic and brand influence remain at the forefront**\n\n![Tenfold business growth, traffic and brand influence remain at the forefront](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/13b2c95c-e165-476b-88f9-a4eb05313136/wechatimg110.jpg)\n\nAfter a year of remarkable growth, MetaEra has presented an outstanding set of achievements:\n\n- The company's annual business revenue surged by over 1020%, with a 960% increase in the number of clients served.\n- The official website experienced a 730% annual growth in visits; the Chinese social media account of X platform boasts 54,000 followers, while the English account has garnered 47,000 followers, reaching a total number of over 100,000 follower across both accounts.\n- Nearly 300 Chinese and English online events were successfully conducted throughout the year. In the latter half, each AMA (Ask Me Anything) session saw an average real-time participation of over 150,000 attendees.\n- In the past year, MetaEra organized as many as 30 global offline events, and MetaEra's media services covered more than 120 offline events. The footprints of \\[MetaEra Event\\] have spanned 4 continents, 15 countries, and 40+ cities around the world...\n\nMetaEra's ascent and triumph are not merely evident in its staggering growth figures, but also interwoven within the narratives of every blockbuster article, perpetuated through the testimonials of new and existing clients, and imbued in the camaraderie of online discussions and in-person encounters. To delve into the code behind this radiant success, one must attribute it to the seamless integration of a constellation of critical elements: astute strategic and product positioning, a global arrangement and operational acumen, an extensive business network and exemplary customer service, and above all, it has a diligent, innovative, and tightly-knit team. This is a distinctive opportunity granted to MetaEra by the zeitgeist and the industry, and a rightful recompense for the team's exceptional cognitive and execution prowess.\n\n**Brand Upgrade: Focusing on Serving the Branding and Growth Needs of Web3.0 Enterprises**\n\nOn September 13, 2024, MetaEra officially announced a brand upgrade, integrating and expanding its existing business lines, and released a new slogan \"Building a Non-fungible Brand For You!\"\n\nThis upgrade not only clearly explains the company's vision: leveraging innovative brand and growth tools,MetaEra efficiently support global customers' brand management and business growth needs in the Web3.0 field; it also clearly expands the platform's main business layout to integrated marketing services (MetaEra PR Agency) and conference services (MetaEra Event).It confirms that MetaEra will use its full range of advantageous resources to provide customers with a series of comprehensive services such as \"media strategy and communication, content creation, KOL marketing, social media and community growth, research and market analysis, brand/growth strategy consulting and data analysis, activities and conference services, public affairs.\"\n\nThis is not only an important milestone in MetaEra's strategic transformation, but also provides clear guidance for the company's future development direction, laying a solid foundation for the further rapid growth of business and traffic.\n\n**Global Expansion Strategy: Targeting China and the United States as Core Markets, Amplifying Regional Business and Operational Competencies**\n\nOn October 31, 2024, the second anniversary of the implementation of the Hong Kong Web 3.0 new policy, MetaEra officially announced the launch of the \\[Hong Kong Zone\\], which provides users with an accurate one-stop Hong Kong Web 3.0 information platform through vertical sections such as \"Hong Kong News,\" \"Influential People,\" \"Policy Tracking,\" and \"Conference Activities,\" fully supporting the development of the Hong Kong Web 3.0 industry.\n\nLooking back, Hong Kong has always been a blessed land filled with warmth and opportunities for MetaEra, a place of fortune and a cradle of possibilities. It not only has unique geographical advantages and policy support, but also attracts the world's top financial and technological talents. From its inception, MetaEra has positioned itself as \"a globally leading media headquartered in Hong Kong,\" committed to supporting and promoting the application of Web 3.0 technology and the development of the cryptocurrency market worldwide. With the development philosophy of \"rooted in Hong Kong, with a global layout,\" MetaEra is always ready and eager to welcome friends from both home and abroad to its office in Cyberport, Hong Kong, for exchange and collaboration.\n\nOn December 16, 2024, MetaEra announced the official establishment of its North American Business and Operations Center in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, New York City.\n\nWith the completion of the 2024 election, the US cryptocurrency market has entered a new era of rapid development with the full support of the new President Trump, and has an extremely important driving force and influence on the global market. As the world's first financial center, New York brings together the world's top banks, exchanges, investment and quantitative institutions, and also has the most cutting-edge regulatory and policy consulting system. MetaEra's New York office will directly support real-time information reporting, business development, and conference activities in the North American region,undertake resource docking and local operational needs from the Asia-Pacific region, and build a one-stop service platform between the Chinese and American Web3.0 markets.The strategic initiative not only further perfects the platform's global landscape, but also directly reflects the long-term strategic plan for the US market.

Through vertical sections such as \"US News,\" \"Policy Tracking,\" \"Industry News,\" and \"Selected Compilation,\" it allows Chinese-speaking users to obtain Web 3.0 industry news and policy trends from the North American continent more quickly.\n\n**2025: Outlook and Vision**\n\nReviewing the past and looking forward to the future, we firmly believe that the Web 3.0 industry will usher in more transformations and opportunities on a global scale in 2025. The China and U.S. markets will jointly become the dual engines driving the industry's development, and information and news platforms will continue to play an indispensable key role in the industry.\n\nMetaEra will continue to push forward, leveraging smarter AI tools and more diverse content presentation methods to offer innovative solutions, which provide users with more precise industry information and support the branding and growth needs of more clients.

With over 3.6 billion users across its platforms, Meta\u2019s influence touches personal communication, digital commerce, content sharing, and social connectivity worldwide.\n\nIn 2024, Meta is making major shifts across these platforms, focusing on emerging trends such as AI, short-form video, immersive technologies, and privacy enhancements. These changes reflect the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to keep up with user demands and industry advancements. By understanding Meta\u2019s 2024 strategy, users, marketers, and businesses can stay competitive in the fast-paced digital world.\n\nThis article explores the marketing strategies and the changes coming to Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, all part of Meta\u2019s broader effort to refine user experiences, empower creators, and strengthen business tools.\n\n### Facebook\u2019s 2024 Strategy\n\nAs Meta\u2019s original and largest platform, Facebook remains a key pillar in Meta\u2019s ecosystem. However, Facebook has faced significant challenges, including competition from newer platforms, changing user preferences, and concerns around privacy. In 2024, Facebook\u2019s strategy will focus on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver more personalized user experiences, fostering community interaction, and placing a renewed emphasis on privacy and security.\n\n1. **Enhanced User Experience**\n\n- **AI-Driven Personalization:** Facebook is intensifying its use of AI to deliver more personalized experiences. Through advanced algorithms, Facebook will recommend content, such as posts, videos, and groups, based on users' preferences and engagement habits. AI will also refine the types of ads users see, offering more relevant and less intrusive advertising experiences. This focus on personalization aims to make Facebook more engaging and enjoyable for its users, helping it compete with platforms like TikTok that rely heavily on algorithm-driven content.\n\n- **Community Building:** In 2024, Facebook will further emphasize community interaction by improving tools for groups, events, and local communities. Users will have access to enhanced features, such as group chats, collaborative projects, and polls, which will make engagement within groups more interactive and meaningful. By focusing on fostering deeper connections, Facebook hopes to build loyalty and keep users engaged for longer periods.\n\n2. **New Features and Updates**\n\n- **Immersive Content (AR/VR Integration):** Meta's push toward the metaverse continues with the integration of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences on Facebook. Users can expect more immersive tools, including AR filters for posts and videos and VR meeting spaces for virtual gatherings. This strategy aligns with Meta's broader vision of blending the digital and physical worlds through interactive and immersive content.\n\n- **Monetization for Creators and Businesses:** Facebook is adding more tools for creators, social media marketers, and businesses to generate revenue. Features such as paid subscriptions, ad revenues, in-app shopping, and virtual goods will allow creators to monetize their content directly on the platform. This move is intended to make Facebook a more attractive destination for influencers and content creators, helping it retain and grow its creator community.\n\n3. **Focus on Privacy and Trust**\n\n- **Data Protection Enhancements:** Facebook is implementing more advanced privacy controls to address user concerns about data privacy. Users will have access to more granular options for managing their data, including the ability to limit data sharing with advertisers and third parties. This focus on data protection aims to rebuild trust with users and reassure them that their information is secure.\n- **Algorithm Transparency:** In response to increasing demands for transparency, Facebook will give users clearer insights into how its algorithms work. Users will have more control over what content is prioritized in their feeds, with the option to switch between algorithm-driven feeds and chronological timelines.\n\n### Instagram\u2019s 2024 Strategy\n\nInstagram has cemented itself as Meta\u2019s hub for visual content, creators, and social commerce. In 2024, Instagram is doubling down on its video-first strategy, emphasizing short-form video and live streaming, while expanding its creator monetization and shopping features. Instagram\u2019s strategic focus for the year is designed to attract content creators, businesses, and everyday users who increasingly expect personalized, video-driven experiences.\n\n1. **Strengthening the Creator Economy**\n\n- **Monetization Tools for Creators:** Instagram is expanding its monetization tools to give creators more opportunities to earn money. In 2024, creators can monetize their content through paid subscriptions, exclusive content offerings, and even non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Tipping and direct payments from fans will also be more widely available. These tools are designed to support the growing creator economy, making Instagram a central platform for influencers and content creators.\n- **Brand Collaborations and Partnerships:** Instagram will enhance its creator marketplace, making it easier for creators and brands to collaborate. The marketplace will use audience demographics and engagement data to match creators with brands that align with their content and values. This streamlined process will foster more authentic partnerships and make it easier for brands to reach their target audiences.\n\n2. **Video-Centric Approach**\n\n- **Reels as the Central Format:** Reels will continue to dominate Instagram\u2019s content strategy, with short-form video becoming the primary format for users. Instagram will improve its video editing tools, adding features like interactive filters, AI-generated content ideas, and split-screen editing. This will enable users to create more engaging and creative content, making Reels a core part of Instagram\u2019s user experience.\n- **Live Streaming Enhancements:** Instagram Live will see several upgrades in 2024. New features like multi-person live streaming, real-time polls, and integrated shopping will make live broadcasts more interactive. Creators will also be able to monetize live streams through tipping and subscription features, turning live content into a profitable avenue.\n\n3. **AI and Personalization**\n\n- **AI-Driven Content Discovery:** Instagram will enhance its algorithm to provide more personalized content recommendations. The Explore tab will be driven by AI, offering users a curated selection of posts, Reels, and accounts to follow based on their interactions and behavior. This personalized approach will help users discover content that aligns with their interests, keeping them engaged on the platform.\n- **Augmented Reality (AR) Features:** Instagram will expand its use of AR, offering creators more advanced tools to create interactive experiences. These AR features will also extend to shopping, allowing users to virtually try on products before purchasing. This blend of entertainment and commerce is part of Instagram\u2019s strategy to integrate shopping into everyday interactions.\n\n4. **Social Commerce and Shopping**\n\n- **In-App Shopping Expansion:** Instagram will further develop its social commerce features, making it easier for users to discover and buy products within the app. Product tags, in-Reel shopping, and integrated checkout options will streamline the shopping process. This continued focus on social commerce will help Instagram maintain its position as a leading platform for businesses and shoppers alike.\n- **Shoppable Reels and Stories:** Shoppable content will become even more prominent in 2024, with Reels and Stories offering seamless shopping experiences. Users will be able to shop directly from videos and Stories, making Instagram a powerful tool for brands to drive sales and connect with consumers.\n\n### WhatsApp\u2019s 2024 Strategy\n\nWhatsApp, Meta\u2019s messaging powerhouse, is known for its simplicity, privacy, and security. In 2024, WhatsApp\u2019s strategy focuses on enhancing its business capabilities, improving group communication, and maintaining its strong commitment to privacy. With over 2 billion users worldwide, WhatsApp is positioning itself as both a personal communication tool and a business platform.\n\n1. **Business Integration**\n\n- **Expansion of WhatsApp Business Tools:** WhatsApp is making significant updates to its Business platform, allowing small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to better manage customer interactions. Advanced tools like automated replies, customer management dashboards, and enhanced chat labels will help businesses streamline communication with customers. These updates aim to make WhatsApp a key tool for businesses looking to connect with consumers in a secure, private environment.\n- **In-App Shopping and Payments:** WhatsApp will expand its shopping and payment capabilities in 2024. Users will be able to browse product catalogs, make purchases, and complete transactions without leaving the app.\n\n2. User Engagement and New Features\n\n- **Enhanced Group Chats and Communities:** WhatsApp is improving group chats with new features that allow better organization and management of large groups. Group admins will have more tools to moderate discussions, while new community-based chat features will enable multiple related groups to be organized under one umbrella.\n\n3. **Privacy and Encryption**\n\n- **End-to-End Encryption Focus:** WhatsApp will continue to prioritize privacy with its end-to-end encryption for messages, calls, and media files. In 2024, the platform will introduce additional transparency around encryption, notifying users when messages are securely encrypted. This move is in response to increasing global scrutiny over data privacy and digital communication security.\n- **Disappearing Messages and Privacy Controls:** WhatsApp is expanding its disappearing message feature, allowing users more flexibility in setting how long messages remain visible. Users will also have greater control over their privacy settings, including the ability to hide their online status, restrict message forwarding, and control who can add them to groups. These features give users more autonomy over their interactions on the platform.\n\n4. **AI-Powered Automation**\n\n- **AI-Driven Customer Service:** WhatsApp will increasingly rely on AI-powered chatbots to help businesses manage customer queries. These bots will handle routine tasks such as answering FAQs, processing orders, and providing product information, allowing businesses to provide efficient customer service around the clock. By integrating AI into customer interactions, WhatsApp is positioning itself as a key player in business communication.\n\n### Meta\u2019s Overall Strategic Goals for 2024\n\nMeta\u2019s strategic focus in 2024 extends beyond individual platform updates. The company is working toward a unified vision that integrates all its platforms under one ecosystem, centred on personalization, AI, and future technologies.\n\n1. **Integration Across Platforms**\n\nMeta aims to create a seamless user experience across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Users will increasingly find integration between platforms, such as cross-platform messaging and unified content experiences. This approach will also extend to immersive technologies, with Meta looking to integrate AR/VR features across all its platforms as part of its metaverse strategy.\n\n2. **Empowering Creators and Businesses**\n\nMeta\u2019s 2024 strategy is heavily focused on empowering creators and businesses. By expanding monetization tools, improving e-commerce features, and offering more personalized advertising, Meta hopes to attract more creators and businesses to its platforms. The creator economy is expected to be a major growth area for Meta, with more creators building careers on its platforms.\n\n3. **AI and Machine Learning for Personalization**\n\nAI will play a central role in Meta\u2019s 2024 strategy. From personalized content recommendations to AI-driven customer service on WhatsApp, Meta is investing heavily in machine learning technologies. These advancements aim to enhance user experiences across its platforms, making interactions more relevant and engaging.\n\n4. **Commitment to Privacy and Trust**\n\nIn response to growing concerns about privacy and data security, Meta is taking steps to strengthen its commitment to user trust. With enhanced privacy controls, algorithm transparency, and stronger encryption, Meta aims to give users more control over their data while adhering to global regulations.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nMeta\u2019s 2024 strategy highlights the company\u2019s focus on AI, video content, and immersive technologies while addressing the need for greater privacy and trust. By enhancing user experiences, supporting creators, and empowering businesses, Meta is positioning itself for continued growth in a highly competitive social media landscape. Whether through Facebook\u2019s community-driven features, Instagram\u2019s video and shopping tools, or WhatsApp\u2019s business integration and privacy focus, Meta is adapting to the changing needs of users and businesses alike.\n\n![Graniteshares](https://graniteshares.com/media/v54ldbla/gs-square-logo.png)\n\n## GraniteShares\n\nGraniteShares\n\n\n## More Research Related to\n\n[3LFB](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/research/ticker/3lfb/ \"\"),\u00a0[3SFB](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/research/ticker/3sfb/ \"\"),\u00a0[3LFE](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/research/ticker/3lfe/ \"\"),\u00a0[3SFE](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/research/ticker/3sfe/ \"\"),\u00a0[3LFP](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/research/ticker/3lfp/ \"\"),\u00a0[3SFP](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/research/ticker/3sfp/ \"\")\n\nRelated Products\n\n[3LFB\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nGraniteShares 3x Long Facebook Daily ETP\\\\\n\\\\\nTechnology](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/etps/graniteshares-3x-leveraged-facebook-etp/ \"\") [3SFB\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nGraniteShares 3x Short Facebook Daily ETP\\\\\n\\\\\nTechnology](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/etps/graniteshares-3x-short-facebook-etp/ \"\") [3LFE\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nGraniteShares 3x Long Facebook Daily ETP\\\\\n\\\\\nTechnology](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/etps/graniteshares-3x-leveraged-facebook-etp/ \"\") [3SFE\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nGraniteShares 3x Short Facebook Daily ETP\\\\\n\\\\\nTechnology](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/etps/graniteshares-3x-short-facebook-etp/ \"\") [3LFP\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nGraniteShares 3x Long Facebook Daily ETP\\\\\n\\\\\nTechnology](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/etps/graniteshares-3x-leveraged-facebook-etp/ \"\") [3SFP\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nGraniteShares 3x Short Facebook Daily ETP\\\\\n\\\\\nTechnology](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/etps/graniteshares-3x-short-facebook-etp/ \"\")\n\nRelated Education\n\n[Lifting of Suspension of New Tranches\\\\\n\\\\\n24 Oct 2024](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/research/lifting-of-suspension-of-new-tranches/ \"Lifting of Suspension of New Tranches\") [Suspension of new Tranches\\\\\n\\\\\n22 Oct 2024](https://graniteshares.com/institutional/uk/en-uk/research/suspension-of-new-tranches/ \"Suspension of new Tranches\") [Suspension Notice -

REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\n\nManuel Orbegozo \\| Reuters\n\n\u201cAut Zuck Aut Nihil\u201d spanned the front of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s loose-fitting black shirt during his keynote at Meta\u2019s Connect event in September.\n\nThe words, donned in all-caps and gray font, were a play on the Latin phrase \u201cAut Caesar Aut Nihil,\u201d which translates to \u201cEither Caesar or nothing\u201d or rather \u201cAll or nothing.\u201d It was a fitting phrase for a company that in 2024 put the full weight of its resources behind its artificial intelligence strategy.\n\nMeta in April said it would [raise its spending levels](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-loses-200-billion-in-value-zuckerberg-focuses-on-ai-metaverse.html) in 2024 by as much as $10 billion to support infrastructure investments for its AI efforts. Although the announcement [sent shares plunging](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-meta-q1-2024-earnings-.html) as much as 19% that evening, investors have come around to the company\u2019s costly AI ambitions. Meta\u2019s stock price hit a [record](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/alphabet-and-tesla-reach-fresh-records-joining-amazon-and-meta-.html) on Dec. 11, and it\u2019s up nearly 70% year to date as of the market\u2019s close on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there,\u201d [Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) said on a call with analysts in October.\n\nHe noted AI\u2019s \u201cpositive impact on nearly all aspects of our work,\u201d highlighting how the technology was key to rebuilding the company\u2019s online advertising business that took a lashing from [Apple](/quotes/AAPL/)\u2019s iOS privacy update in 2021. Additionally, he said AI underpins Meta\u2019s more nascent projects, such as its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and experimental [Orion augmented reality headset](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/meta-finally-finds-success-in-ar-vr-three-years-after-changing-name.html) that Zuckerberg believes could represent \u201cthe next computing platform.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s comments about AI underscore how the technology has become Meta\u2019s top priority, directly impacting the company\u2019s business and potentially paving the way for future revenue opportunities. Unlike the company\u2019s more conventional services, like Instagram and Facebook, AI is an infrastructure technology that Zuckerberg wants hardwired into its various products, particularly as competitors like OpenAI continue to make inroads with consumers.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s GPT family of AI models help power apps like ChatGPT, Meta\u2019s [family of Llama AI models](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/metas-open-source-approach-to-ai-puzzles-wall-street-techies-love-it.html) feeds the company\u2019s newer generative AI features like the Meta AI digital assistant. That chatbot represents Zuckerberg\u2019s primary way to introduce generative AI technologies to its billions of users.\n\n\u201cMeta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year,\u201d Zuckerberg said at Connect.\n\nThe company has been increasingly releasing new generative AI features for advertisers to continue improving the efficiency of its online advertising platform. And with the hiring last month of Clara Shih, who had been [Salesforce\u2019s](/quotes/CRM/) CEO of AI, to lead a new business AI group, Meta aims to build a more enterprise-focused unit in the new year.\n\n![The Meta AI logo is being displayed on a smartphone in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on June 10, 2024.

In April, the company brought it to the forefront of each of the apps in its empire by putting Meta AI in the search bars of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nBut because the company doesn\u2019t offer a stand-alone Meta AI app, it\u2019s difficult to directly compare its usage to similar services like ChatGPT or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, said David Curry, the data editor for insights firm Business of Apps.\n\nWhen it comes to monthly active users, the most popular of these generative AI chatbot apps is ChatGPT by a wide margin, followed by [Google](/quotes/GOOGL/) Gemini, [Microsoft](/quotes/MSFT/) Copilot, Claude and Perplexity, Curry said.\n\nThe Meta AI \u201cstandalone website gets less than 10 million views per month, putting it far below the major services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) and even lower than some mid-range players like Anthropic,\u201d Curry said, based on data he accessed via the Similarweb web-tracking service.\n\nMeta\u2019s finance chief, Susan Li, [told](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/META-Q2-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf) analysts in July that India has become the company\u2019s \u201clargest market for Meta AI usage.\u201d That usage has coincided with promising signs of [retention and engagement on WhatsApp](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/metas-whatsapp-is-chasing-big-businesses-to-capitalize-on-popularity.html), Li added.\n\n![Tourists are seen at the forecourt of the iconic Gateway of India as a digital display of messaging app WhatsApp is displayed, in Mumbai on August 25, 2023.

Ravan said he finds Meta AI, which he uses through WhatsApp, helpful for learning about the history of songs that he enjoys. He also uses it as a tool to learn about people in the music industry who he plans to work with or meet, describing it as great for preparation.\n\nSathish Thiyagarajan, 30, a technical support engineer for marketing tech firm GoX.AI, said he\u2019s increasingly using Meta AI as a search tool via WhatsApp, which he noted dominates the Indian market for mobile internet communications.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m talking with my family or my friends, if they\u2019re saying something to me and I have to search something, I\u2019m not going to go to Google,\u201d said Thiyagarajan, of Chennai, India. \u201cI\u2019m just going to put the phone in the speaker mode, and I\u2019ll immediately search through Meta AI.\u201d\n\nHowever, Thiyagarajan said he only uses Meta AI when he\u2019s on his phone. If he\u2019s at his computer, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is his preferred AI chatbot.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of Meta AI\u2019s bundling into WhatsApp\u2019s search functions.\n\nJawhar Sircar, 72 **,** a retired government official in Kolkata, India, called the Meta AI search feature in WhatsApp \u201cquite a nuisance.\u201d That\u2019s because whenever a user pauses while typing out a name in the search-find box, the Meta AI technology quickly \u201cpicks up whatever has been typed\u201d and generates what he describes as unnecessary search prompt suggestions.\n\nAs far as the popularity of Meta AI in India, Sircar said he thinks the feature is mostly used by companies, technologists and other professionals who \u201care getting hooked to AI\u201d alongside the Indian government\u2019s continued investment in regional computing infrastructure.\n\n\u201cProfessionals and companies have started using AI, but the general user has no need, at least not on the Meta platforms,\u201d Sircar wrote in an email.\n\n## Meta\u2019s AI strategy for advertisers\n\nAdvertising is still the key to revenue.\n\nMeta\u00a0[said](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/02/production-engineering/meta-andromeda-advantage-automation-next-gen-personalized-ads-retrieval-engine/)\u00a0in December that over 1 million advertisers had used the company\u2019s GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in a single month.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a +7% increase in conversions,\u201d Meta said at the time, regarding its image generation features.\n\nWhile people may [associate generative AI](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/08/how-the-generative-ai-boom-could-forever-change-online-advertising.html) with the visually striking and sometimes surreal imagery derived from popular services like Dall-E or Midjourney, it\u2019s more likely that the average small business advertiser uses Meta\u2019s GenAI tools for more subtle tasks, said Stacy Reed, an online advertising and Facebook ads consultant.\n\nThat includes using AI to create multiple versions of an ad\u2019s headline, auto-resizing the size of ads so they look appropriate within users\u2019 Instagram and Facebook apps, and repositioning certain images within the ads so that the promotions perform better, Reed said.\n\nAdvertisers that already write strong, creative copy can ask Meta\u2019s GenAI tools for \u201ca little bit more\u201d help, Reed said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you win with their AI tools,\u201d she said.\n\nReed said the many small advertisers she supports aren\u2019t associating the new features with AI. They \u201cthink that Meta is just enhancing the way you build ads,\u201d Reed said.\n\n![How Meta's $19 billion bet on WhatsApp could finally start paying off](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107294825-1693541615805-GettyImages-1001511110.jpg?v=1694771657&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:0610:06\n\nHow Meta\u2019s $19 billion bet on WhatsApp could finally start paying off\n\n[Tech](https://www.cnbc.com/technology/)\n\nCelina Guerrero, an independent corporate sales and training consultant, said she uses Meta\u2019s GenAI tools to help with writing headlines for her ads, but she said she finds Meta\u2019s advertising interface to be confusing and constantly changing.\n\n\u201cIt is visually overwhelming from a user experience,\u201d Guerrero said.\n\nAhead of a Facebook ad campaign planned for January, Guerrero said she is debating how to use Meta\u2019s GenAI tools for more in-depth tasks, like modifying her ad\u2019s entire in-line copy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my copy to sound like ChatGPT,\u201d Guerrero said, referring to the sterile, run-of-the-mill AI-generated text that\u2019s proliferating the web. \u201cI have two options: One, I don\u2019t use the variations, or two, I spend an inordinate amount of hours editing it.\u201d\n\nMost big companies and advertising agencies are turning to more marketing-specific tools for their generative AI-based ad campaigns, said Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester. Those services are more robust than Meta\u2019s built-in AI ad tools, he said.\n\nStill, the mere introduction of simple GenAI tools is beneficial to Metaconsidering it dominates the digital ads market along with Google. Meta\u2019s generative AI tools just have \u201cto be good enough to squeeze out more investment\u201d from advertisers, said Maurice Rahmey, CEO of performance marketing firm Disruptive Digital and a former Facebook customer manager.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better for their business, even if it\u2019s just those small, incremental changes,\u201d Rahmey said \u201cIt\u2019s a business of scale.\u201d\n\n![Clara Shih, Former CEO of Salesforce AI](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107142106-1666901089565-gettyimages-490159117-WIRED_BIZCON.jpeg?v=1734733934&w=1858&h=1045&vtcrop=y)\n\nClara Shih, Former CEO of Salesforce AI\n\nBloomberg \\| Bloomberg \\| Getty Images\n\n## What\u2019s next for Meta\u2019s enterprise play?\n\nWith Meta\u2019s hiring of Shih from Salesforce in November, some analysts say Meta could make an enterprise technology push with its [Llama family of open-source AI models](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/16/metas-open-source-approach-to-ai-puzzles-wall-street-techies-love-it.html).\n\nLlama\u2019s advancements \u201crepresent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers,\u201d Meta monetization head John Hegeman said in a statement.\n\nShih, who was one of [CNBC\u2019s 2024 changemakers](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/clara-shih-cnbc-changemakers.html), rejoined Salesforce in 2020 after previously working at the company from 2006 through 2009. As part of her most recent role at Salesforce, Shih helped oversee Einstein GPT for Service and Sales, a GenAI product intended for sales and customer support staff.\n\nDuring her first stint at Salesforce, Shih created a business app that let users connect their Salesforce customer relationship software with their Facebook connections. In 2009, she wrote \u201cThe Facebook Era,\u201d a book intended for professionals to better understand how to use social networks for business.\n\nMultiple former Meta AI and product leaders told CNBC that Shih\u2019s vast experience will be helpful considering the company has failed in previous attempts at building enterprise software.\n\nMeta [announced](https://www.facebook.com/help/1167689491269151/) in May that it plans to shut down Workplace, its business communications product, by 2026. And after buying enterprise startup Kustomer for about $1 billion in 2020, Meta spun it out in 2023 in a deal that was [reportedly](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-strikes-deal-to-divest-itself-of-kustomer-8e945431) valued at $250 million.\n\nThe most logical step for Meta would be to create a [larger business around WhatsApp](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/01/metas-whatsapp-is-chasing-big-businesses-to-capitalize-on-popularity.html), said Ralph Schackart, an internet equity analyst at investment bank William Blair. Specifically, WhatsApp could help businesses build customer-service chatbots using Meta\u2019s GenAI, Schackart said.\n\n\u201cLonger term, this is going to evolve into customized sales agents, which is a $3 trillion-plus industry,\u201d Schackart said about Meta\u2019s WhatsApp business AI chatbot opportunity.\n\n**WATCH**: [If the U.S. bans TikTok, China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/12/06/if-the-u-s-bans-tiktok-china-could-retaliate-and-target-tesla-and-apple-deepwaters-gene-munster.html).\n\n![If the U.S. bans TikTok China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple: Deepwater's Gene Munster](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108072817-17335249551733524950-37440314808-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1733524953&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:2304:23\n\nIf the U.S. bans TikTok China could retaliate and target Tesla and Apple: Deepwater\u2019s Gene Munster\n\n[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fastmoney/)\n\n[iframe](https://sp.auth.adobe.com/entitlement/v4/AccessEnablerProxy.html?a4f31600ce9c60894320#https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F12%2F23%2Fmeta-went-all-in-on-ai-in-2024-the-pressure-builds-in-2025.html)\n\n[iframe](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfnMFMeAAAAABvWy2u0ZzAqPaVUflZOPibgK-u5&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=zIriijn3uj5Vpknvt_LnfNbF&size=invisible&cb=f8g3d2yddj2p)",

The 2024 Responsible Business Practices Report details progress in these pillars.\n\nThis year\u2019s report was prepared in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and informed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Internet and Media Services Industry Standards, the United Nations Global Compact and the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n**Unlocking Potential for Good**\n\nEmerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse represent Meta\u2019s long-term bets on the future. In 2023, these technological pathways began to intersect in the form of products, apps and services that help bring the metaverse to life. This year\u2019s report highlights efforts to develop these and other technologies responsibly, openly and transparently, with a focus on open source innovation.\n\nIn 2023, Meta made strides toward its goal of building general intelligence that\u2019s accessible to all by releasing Llama, a collection of open source LLMs. Meta believes access to cutting-edge AI can unlock potential for individuals around the world, and is proud to report that its models have been downloaded more than 170 million times since release.\n\n**Report Highlights**\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s report is unlocking potential. The report provides insights centered on the goal of creating positive change through open and transparent operations, app development and employee and partner relationships.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\n- **Providing access to cutting-edge AI** for individuals around the world through the release of Llama, Meta\u2019s collection of open-source LLMs\n- **Launching the** [**AI Alliance**](https://thealliance.ai/) to accelerate responsible AI innovation, in collaboration with more than 50 companies and organizations\n- **Expanding parental supervision tools** globally to Facebook, Messenger and Horizon Worlds\n- **Providing the infrastructure for** [**Lantern**](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/lantern-program-protecting-children-online/), a program enabling technology companies to share signals about accounts and behaviors that violate child safety policies\n- **Becoming founding members of Take It Down**, a platform designed to help prevent young people\u2019s intimate images from spreading online\n- **Completing a Human Rights Salient Risk Assessment**, paying special attention to the rights, needs and challenges of individuals at heightened risk of becoming vulnerable or marginalized\n- **Maintaining net zero** in global operations, and establishing a science-based emissions reduction target and decarbonization roadmap to systematically transform the way Meta does business\n- **Continuing to focus on building a diverse workforce** that reflects and supports Meta\u2019s ability to serve billions of users around the globe\n\n**Further Reporting**\n\nThe Responsible Business Practices Report is\u00a0supplemented by in-depth reports on key areas such as human rights, sustainability and transparency, to provide a detailed overview of our business practices and progress.\n\nToday, Meta is also launching its third annual\u00a0[Human Rights Report](https://humanrights.fb.com/annual-human-rights-report/?utm_source=newsroom&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=HuRiLaunch), which reflects a commitment\u00a0 to understanding, preventing and mitigating its highest priority human rights risks. In August, the company published its annual\u00a0[Sustainability Report](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2024-sustainability-report/), which outlines the progress made toward net zero, climate, water, energy and supply chain goals. And Meta regularly publishes\u00a0[transparency reports](https://transparency.meta.com/reports/) to give the community visibility into how it enforces its policies, responds to data requests and protects intellectual property, while monitoring dynamics that limit access to Meta technologies.\n\nYou can read the full Responsible Business Practices Report to learn more about responsible business practices at Meta.\n\n![Meta logo](https://back.3blmedia.com/sites/default/files/Clients/meta_NewSite_Tile.png)\n\n## Meta\n\n## Meta\n\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities and grow businesses.

recommendations](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#content4)\n\n* * *\n\n### The 2023 picture \u2013 META\n\nThe first half of this year has seen META consumers returning to increased level of spending for Consumer Tech & Durables (T&D) \u2013 especially domestic appliances.\n\nAfter the sharp growth in sales for META\u2019s T&D market in 2020 and 2021, last year\u2019s revenue stayed flat. However, the first six months this year have seen a +4% increase in revenue compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nPurchases of domestic appliances have led this positive bound, driven by new markets opening in the Middle East, and inflationary restrictions in Turkey and South Africa driving a change in consumers\u2019 willingness to buy. Sales revenue has been especially strong for small domestic appliances, growing +41% in January to June this year compared to the same period last year.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-1.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## Product innovation\n\nDisruption driven by launches of products offering dramatic innovation has been low this year. This means that META\u2019s consumers have often not always seeing a persuasive reason to buy the latest, newly launched products in certain categories, rather than buying an older model. Across TVs, tablets and some home appliances, models launched two or more years ago make up the same share of purchases as we were seeing in 2019. An exception is smartphones, where new models have taken a greater share in Q1 this year compared to Q1 2019.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-2.png?w=1024)\n\nWhile significant discounts obviously impact retailers\u2019 margins, promotional activities seen across META so far this year are approaching levels last seen in 2019. These events are motivating consumers to open their wallets, and we expect similar promotions will be crucial to trigger volume demand in the remainder of 2023.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-3.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## What factors will drive consumer spend in 2024+?\n\n1\\. Product lifetime costs\n\n- [1\\. Product lifetime costs](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#niq-tab-0 \"1.

Environment and sustainability](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#niq-tab-3 \"4. Environment and sustainability\")\n\nAs well as price, shoppers are also considering a product\u2019s operational costs across its full lifetime \u2013 it\u2019s durability, repairability, energy use. The crucial question is: which factor takes the lead at point of purchase?\n\n- 41% of panel TV buyers globally say \u201cdurability\u201d is an important aspect in making product choice \u2013 up 14 pp in two years.\n- 41% of consumers in META bought energy-saving products to save money in the long run\n\nSource: gfknewron Consumer 2023 & GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\nRobotic, multifunctional, smart, and cordless products that are easy to use and make lives more convenient continue to outperform the category average. Opportunities lie in products offering AI-controlled energy saving.\n\n- 57% in META say \u201cI really like the idea of technology that \u2018knows\u2019 me and can make recommendations and take actions based on my wants and needs\u201d\n- 49% in META are prepared to pay more for products that make their life easier\n\nSource: GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\nAspirational design continues to drive purchases, but \u201csolutions looking for a problem\u201d are out. People are keeping their \u2018treat myself\u2019 spend for products designed specifically for them as an individual. Examples can be seen across gaming, digital content creation, photography, gardening, and more.\n\n- 46% in META say \u201cIt is important to indulge or pamper myself on a regular basis\u201d\n- 54% in META say \u201cI like to buy products that can be tailored to my needs.\u201d\n\nSource: GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\n70% of people in META see \u201cGlobal climate change / global warming\u201d as a very or extremely serious issue. This affects consumer spending in two ways:\n\n- **Needs-based purchases** to combat climate effects: electric fans, air purifiers, air conditioners\n- **Values-based purchases** that support products and brands that are eco-friendly.\n\nConsumers\u2019 expectations here are expanding. In order to be perceived as genuinely eco-friendly, manufacturers and retailers need to be able to point to everything from the suppliers they work with; to their products\u2019 material, packaging, transportation, durability, recyclability; to their support of environmental or humanitarian causes.\n\nThis is a natural expansion of what we are already seeing at product level. In the EU5\u2019s highly competitive smartphone, mobile and phablet market, two-thirds of sales revenue in January to June this year came from products that have 3 or more eco-claims. With a growth rate of +22%, these items are substantially out-performing the rest.\n\n* * *\n\n## Planning for 2024+ global recommendations\n\n**How do manufacturers and retailers capitalize on the consumer trends above to shape an ambitious but sustainable strategic plan and budget allocation for 2024+?**\n\nWith budget planning for 2024 in full swing, these are our global recommendations on how to drive growth over the next few years. The local market and consumer landscape set out above will drive how best these are implemented at regional and country level.\n\n01\n\n#### Invest in targeted innovation (product & service)\n\nInnovation continues to appeal but must deliver value that is directly relevant to the consumer\u2019s life. Develop targeted, consumer-centric use-cases that show the benefits of upgrading to \u2018affordable premium\u2019 models.\n\n02\n\n#### Build up your brand to be a differentiator, as well as your product\n\nThe emotional connection between consumers and a brand plays a crucial role in competitive markets. Balance tactical activity with long-term, upper-funnel brand marketing that allows you to differentiate based on brand, rather than product or pricing alone.\n\n03\n\n#### Intensify manufacturer-retailer collaboration to optimize omnichannel category management\n\nBy teaming up to deliver consumer-centric planning that is unified across their respective merchandising, marketing, and supply chains, manufacturers and their retailers can optimise their mutual goal of creating a consistently personalised and enjoyable product experience at every touchpoint.\n\n04\n\n#### Planning for the upcoming shopper generation:\n\nGen Z will soon surpass millennials in size. Two-thirds are aged 15-24 and starting to frame opinions about brands. They consume 53% more content than the average but spend 50% less time on content than millennials. Like any generation, they include complex segments with differing demands.\n\n05\n\n#### Review regional and category footprint to capitalize regional growth opportunities and mitigate individual category risks\n\nEach region has unique market, category, and consumer dynamics. Manufacturers and retailers must have a full view across all regions and categories, and map this against their own portfolio, to pinpoint where growth opportunities exist for their products.\n\n## Mega-trends shaping T&D sales in 2024+\n\nGet your free copy of the report now\n\n[Download the full report](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2023/global-industry-report-executive-summary-meta/#)\n\n##### Related content\n\n[![2025 will see Tech & Durables back to growth: NIQ full-year sales estimate\u00a0](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/GettyImages-1339801320-1200x800-5b2df79-2.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2025/2025-will-see-tech-durables-back-to-growth-niq-full-year-estimate/)[![Elevating business decision-making](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/Hama-case.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/success-story/2024/hama-elevating-business-decision-making/)[![Monitoring a market in motion](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/ANVR.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/success-story/2024/anvr-elevating-business-decision-making/)[![Early lessons from Cyber Monday 2024](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/GettyImages-103919691-1200x800-5b2df79.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/early-lessons-from-cyber-monday-2024/)\n\n![](https://pixel.wp.com/g.gif?v=ext&blog=183887514&post=451246&tz=0&srv=nielseniq.com&hp=vip&j=1%3A14.0&host=nielseniq.com&ref=&fcp=0&rand=0.11383096579898222)",

We have challenged ourselves to do this sustainably, building better realities \u2014 and not just virtual ones.\n\nAt Meta, we believe sustainability is about more than operating responsibly; it is an opportunity to support the communities we are part of and have a positive impact on the world.\n\nOur annual Sustainability Report outlines our progress to address our emissions, as well as the energy and water used to power our business, products and workplaces \u2014 while protecting workers and the environment in our supply chain.\n\nWith that, we\u2019re proud to share our [2024 Sustainability Report](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2024-sustainability-report/).\n\n### Highlights from our 2024 report include:\n\n- Since 2020, we have **maintained net zero emissions in our global operations.** To achieve and maintain this commitment, we reduced our emissions by 94% from a 2017 baseline primarily by matching 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy. At the end of 2023, our portfolio included over 11.7 GW of contracted renewable energy, making Meta one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy globally.\n- Our 18 operational water restoration projects **returned 1.5 billion gallons of water to high and medium water stress regions** as part of our water positive goal to restore more water overall than we consume in 2030.\n- By the end of 2023, **28% of our suppliers,** based on their contribution to Meta\u2019s emissions, **have set science-aligned emissions reduction targets**.\n- We **set a science-based emissions reduction target** and **roadmapped a\u00a0 decarbonization strategy** to systematically transform the way we do business.\n\nWorking toward sustainable climate solutions is a cross-industry effort. Our collaborations underpin how we operate and what we create \u2014 we know it will take everyone working together to make the systems level changes required to build a climate-resilient better reality: sustainability experts, researchers, local utilities, nonprofit organizations, and our employees. This is how we will protect the wellbeing of people and our planet, and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\n\n## News\n\nGet the latest news about our sustainability work, download reports and resources and explore our energy dashboards.\n\n[Learn More](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/news-resources/ \"Learn More\")\n\n![](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Eng-Blog-Retinas-Featured-Image.jpg?fit=700%2C394&resize=700%2C394)\n\nClimate\nEngineering at Meta\n\n### [RETINAS: Real-Time Infrastructure Accounting for Sustainability](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/08/26/data-infrastructure/retinas-real-time-infrastructure-accounting-for-sustainability/ \"RETINAS: Real-Time Infrastructure Accounting for Sustainability\")\n\nActionable metrics to help reduce emissions by improving our utilization and efficiency of Meta\u2019s data center server fleet.\n\nAugust 26, 2024\n\nOpen Article\n\n![A man and woman walking through area with shipping containers.](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RFP-hero.jpeg?fit=700%2C467&resize=700%2C467)\n\nNews\n\n### [RFP: Value Chain Interventions for Emissions Reductions](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/07/16/rfp-value-chain-interventions-for-emissions-reductions/ \"RFP: Value Chain Interventions for Emissions Reductions\")\n\nMeta is initiating a public RFP in order to pursue scalable solutions for CO2e reductions.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nView Article\n\n![Symbiosis Coalition logo](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/444780933_968569445060713_6647720965754446999_n.png?fit=700%2C467&resize=700%2C467)\n\nClimate\nSymbiosis Coalition\n\n### [Announcing the Symbiosis Coalition](https://www.symbiosiscoalition.org/perspectives/launch-press-release \"Announcing the Symbiosis Coalition\")\n\nThe coalition aims to facilitate an up to 20M ton advance market commitment to support nature-based carbon removal projects by 2030 that drive positive outcomes for people and planet.\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nOpen Article\n\n## Focus areas\n\nAt Meta, we\u2019re building a better reality at every level of our impact.\n\n![top down image of ocean water](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AdobeStock_102358080-1-crop.jpg?resize=800%2C800)\n\nOn our planet\n\nTaking daily action toward net zero\n\n[Climate](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/climate/)\n\n![Romantic golden sunset river lake fog loving couple small rowing boat](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/water-biodiversity-compressed.jpg?resize=500%2C500)\n\nWith our resources\n\nPromoting resiliency and restoring loss\n\n[Water](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/water/)\n\n[Biodiversity](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/biodiversity/)\n\n![Solar panels and wind turbines](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-539998802-crop.jpg?resize=800%2C800)\n\nAcross our footprint\n\nDriving efficient management of resources\n\n[Energy](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/energy/)\n\n[Responsible supply chain](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/responsible-supply-chain/)\n\n![Exterior of ATN facility](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ATN-Exterior-resize-crop.jpg?resize=800%2C800)\n\nWithin our facilities\n\nMeeting the highest standards for sustainable buildings\n\n[Data centers](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/data-centers/)\n\n[Offices](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/offices/)\n\n![Happy businesspeople having a discussion during a meeting](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AdobeStock_497220421-crop.jpg?resize=500%2C500)\n\nThroughout our business\n\nWorking together for the highest outcome\n\n[Responsible AI](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/responsible-ai/)\n\n### 2024 Sustainability Report\n\nLearn more about our progress as we work to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain and become water positive in 2030.\n\n[Download the full report](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/asset/2024-sustainability-report/)\n\n![Person kayaking in lake](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kayak.avif?w=1620)\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

America](#content1)\n- [Product innovation](#content2)\n- [What factors will drive consumer spend in 2024+](#content3)\n- [Planning for 2024+ global recommendations](#content4)\n\n* * *\n\n### The 2023 picture \u2013 META\n\nThe first half of this year has seen META consumers returning to increased level of spending for Consumer Tech & Durables (T&D) \u2013 especially domestic appliances.\n\nAfter the sharp growth in sales for META\u2019s T&D market in 2020 and 2021, last year\u2019s revenue stayed flat. However, the first six months this year have seen a +4% increase in revenue compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nPurchases of domestic appliances have led this positive bound, driven by new markets opening in the Middle East, and inflationary restrictions in Turkey and South Africa driving a change in consumers\u2019 willingness to buy. Sales revenue has been especially strong for small domestic appliances, growing +41% in January to June this year compared to the same period last year.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-1.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## Product innovation\n\nDisruption driven by launches of products offering dramatic innovation has been low this year. This means that META\u2019s consumers have often not always seeing a persuasive reason to buy the latest, newly launched products in certain categories, rather than buying an older model. Across TVs, tablets and some home appliances, models launched two or more years ago make up the same share of purchases as we were seeing in 2019. An exception is smartphones, where new models have taken a greater share in Q1 this year compared to Q1 2019.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-2.png?w=1024)\n\nWhile significant discounts obviously impact retailers\u2019 margins, promotional activities seen across META so far this year are approaching levels last seen in 2019. These events are motivating consumers to open their wallets, and we expect similar promotions will be crucial to trigger volume demand in the remainder of 2023.\n\n![](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/State-of-manufacturer-META-image-3.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## What factors will drive consumer spend in 2024+?\n\n1\\. Product lifetime costs\n\n- [1\\. Product lifetime costs](#niq-tab-0 \"1. Product lifetime costs\")\n- [2\\. Making life easier](#niq-tab-1 \"2. Making life easier\")\n- [3\\. Individualism and the tailored experience](#niq-tab-2 \"3. Individualism and the tailored experience\")\n- [4\\. Environment and sustainability](#niq-tab-3 \"4. Environment and sustainability\")\n\nAs well as price, shoppers are also considering a product\u2019s operational costs across its full lifetime \u2013 it\u2019s durability, repairability, energy use. The crucial question is: which factor takes the lead at point of purchase?\n\n- 41% of panel TV buyers globally say \u201cdurability\u201d is an important aspect in making product choice \u2013 up 14 pp in two years.\n- 41% of consumers in META bought energy-saving products to save money in the long run\n\nSource: gfknewron Consumer 2023 & GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\nRobotic, multifunctional, smart, and cordless products that are easy to use and make lives more convenient continue to outperform the category average. Opportunities lie in products offering AI-controlled energy saving.\n\n- 57% in META say \u201cI really like the idea of technology that \u2018knows\u2019 me and can make recommendations and take actions based on my wants and needs\u201d\n- 49% in META are prepared to pay more for products that make their life easier\n\nSource: GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\nAspirational design continues to drive purchases, but \u201csolutions looking for a problem\u201d are out. People are keeping their \u2018treat myself\u2019 spend for products designed specifically for them as an individual. Examples can be seen across gaming, digital content creation, photography, gardening, and more.\n\n- 46% in META say \u201cIt is important to indulge or pamper myself on a regular basis\u201d\n- 54% in META say \u201cI like to buy products that can be tailored to my needs.\u201d\n\nSource: GfK Consumer Life 2023\n\n70% of people in META see \u201cGlobal climate change / global warming\u201d as a very or extremely serious issue. This affects consumer spending in two ways:\n\n- **Needs-based purchases** to combat climate effects: electric fans, air purifiers, air conditioners\n- **Values-based purchases** that support products and brands that are eco-friendly.\n\nConsumers\u2019 expectations here are expanding. In order to be perceived as genuinely eco-friendly, manufacturers and retailers need to be able to point to everything from the suppliers they work with; to their products\u2019 material, packaging, transportation, durability, recyclability; to their support of environmental or humanitarian causes.\n\nThis is a natural expansion of what we are already seeing at product level. In the EU5\u2019s highly competitive smartphone, mobile and phablet market, two-thirds of sales revenue in January to June this year came from products that have 3 or more eco-claims. With a growth rate of +22%, these items are substantially out-performing the rest.\n\n* * *\n\n## Planning for 2024+ global recommendations\n\n**How do manufacturers and retailers capitalize on the consumer trends above to shape an ambitious but sustainable strategic plan and budget allocation for 2024+?**\n\nWith budget planning for 2024 in full swing, these are our global recommendations on how to drive growth over the next few years. The local market and consumer landscape set out above will drive how best these are implemented at regional and country level.\n\n01\n\n#### Invest in targeted innovation (product & service)\n\nInnovation continues to appeal but must deliver value that is directly relevant to the consumer\u2019s life. Develop targeted, consumer-centric use-cases that show the benefits of upgrading to \u2018affordable premium\u2019 models.\n\n02\n\n#### Build up your brand to be a differentiator, as well as your product\n\nThe emotional connection between consumers and a brand plays a crucial role in competitive markets. Balance tactical activity with long-term, upper-funnel brand marketing that allows you to differentiate based on brand, rather than product or pricing alone.\n\n03\n\n#### Intensify manufacturer-retailer collaboration to optimize omnichannel category management\n\nBy teaming up to deliver consumer-centric planning that is unified across their respective merchandising, marketing, and supply chains, manufacturers and their retailers can optimise their mutual goal of creating a consistently personalised and enjoyable product experience at every touchpoint.\n\n04\n\n#### Planning for the upcoming shopper generation:\n\nGen Z will soon surpass millennials in size. Two-thirds are aged 15-24 and starting to frame opinions about brands. They consume 53% more content than the average but spend 50% less time on content than millennials. Like any generation, they include complex segments with differing demands.\n\n05\n\n#### Review regional and category footprint to capitalize regional growth opportunities and mitigate individual category risks\n\nEach region has unique market, category, and consumer dynamics. Manufacturers and retailers must have a full view across all regions and categories, and map this against their own portfolio, to pinpoint where growth opportunities exist for their products.\n\n## Mega-trends shaping T&D sales in 2024+\n\nGet your free copy of the report now\n\nDownload the full report\n\n##### Related content\n\n[![2025 will see Tech & Durables back to growth: NIQ full-year sales estimate\u00a0](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/GettyImages-1339801320-1200x800-5b2df79-2.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2025/2025-will-see-tech-durables-back-to-growth-niq-full-year-estimate/)[![Elevating business decision-making](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/Hama-case.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/success-story/2024/hama-elevating-business-decision-making/)[![Monitoring a market in motion](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/ANVR.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/success-story/2024/anvr-elevating-business-decision-making/)[![Early lessons from Cyber Monday 2024](https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/12/GettyImages-103919691-1200x800-5b2df79.jpg?w=1024)](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/early-lessons-from-cyber-monday-2024/)\n\n![](https://pixel.wp.com/g.gif?v=ext&blog=183887514&post=451246&tz=0&srv=nielseniq.com&hp=vip&j=1%3A14.0&host=nielseniq.com&ref=&fcp=0&rand=0.46438625725028526)",

We have challenged ourselves to do this sustainably, building better realities \u2014 and not just virtual ones.\n\nAt Meta, we believe sustainability is about more than operating responsibly; it is an opportunity to support the communities we are part of and have a positive impact on the world.\n\nOur annual Sustainability Report outlines our progress to address our emissions, as well as the energy and water used to power our business, products and workplaces \u2014 while protecting workers and the environment in our supply chain.\n\nWith that, we\u2019re proud to share our [2024 Sustainability Report](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2024-sustainability-report/).\n\n### Highlights from our 2024 report include:\n\n- Since 2020, we have **maintained net zero emissions in our global operations.** To achieve and maintain this commitment, we reduced our emissions by 94% from a 2017 baseline primarily by matching 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy. At the end of 2023, our portfolio included over 11.7 GW of contracted renewable energy, making Meta one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy globally.\n- Our 18 operational water restoration projects **returned 1.5 billion gallons of water to high and medium water stress regions** as part of our water positive goal to restore more water overall than we consume in 2030.\n- By the end of 2023, **28% of our suppliers,** based on their contribution to Meta\u2019s emissions, **have set science-aligned emissions reduction targets**.\n- We **set a science-based emissions reduction target** and **roadmapped a\u00a0 decarbonization strategy** to systematically transform the way we do business.\n\nWorking toward sustainable climate solutions is a cross-industry effort. Our collaborations underpin how we operate and what we create \u2014 we know it will take everyone working together to make the systems level changes required to build a climate-resilient better reality: sustainability experts, researchers, local utilities, nonprofit organizations, and our employees. This is how we will protect the wellbeing of people and our planet, and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\n\n## News\n\nGet the latest news about our sustainability work, download reports and resources and explore our energy dashboards.\n\n[Learn More](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/news-resources/ \"Learn More\")\n\n![](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Eng-Blog-Retinas-Featured-Image.jpg?fit=700%2C394&resize=700%2C394)\n\nClimate\nEngineering at Meta\n\n### [RETINAS: Real-Time Infrastructure Accounting for Sustainability](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/08/26/data-infrastructure/retinas-real-time-infrastructure-accounting-for-sustainability/ \"RETINAS: Real-Time Infrastructure Accounting for Sustainability\")\n\nActionable metrics to help reduce emissions by improving our utilization and efficiency of Meta\u2019s data center server fleet.\n\nAugust 26, 2024\n\nOpen Article\n\n![A man and woman walking through area with shipping containers.](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RFP-hero.jpeg?fit=700%2C467&resize=700%2C467)\n\nNews\n\n### [RFP: Value Chain Interventions for Emissions Reductions](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/07/16/rfp-value-chain-interventions-for-emissions-reductions/ \"RFP: Value Chain Interventions for Emissions Reductions\")\n\nMeta is initiating a public RFP in order to pursue scalable solutions for CO2e reductions.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nView Article\n\n![Symbiosis Coalition logo](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/444780933_968569445060713_6647720965754446999_n.png?fit=700%2C467&resize=700%2C467)\n\nClimate\nSymbiosis Coalition\n\n### [Announcing the Symbiosis Coalition](https://www.symbiosiscoalition.org/perspectives/launch-press-release \"Announcing the Symbiosis Coalition\")\n\nThe coalition aims to facilitate an up to 20M ton advance market commitment to support nature-based carbon removal projects by 2030 that drive positive outcomes for people and planet.\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nOpen Article\n\n## Focus areas\n\nAt Meta, we\u2019re building a better reality at every level of our impact.\n\n![top down image of ocean water](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AdobeStock_102358080-1-crop.jpg?resize=800%2C800)\n\nOn our planet\n\nTaking daily action toward net zero\n\n[Climate](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/climate/)\n\n![Romantic golden sunset river lake fog loving couple small rowing boat](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/water-biodiversity-compressed.jpg?resize=500%2C500)\n\nWith our resources\n\nPromoting resiliency and restoring loss\n\n[Water](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/water/)\n\n[Biodiversity](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/biodiversity/)\n\n![Solar panels and wind turbines](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-539998802-crop.jpg?resize=800%2C800)\n\nAcross our footprint\n\nDriving efficient management of resources\n\n[Energy](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/energy/)\n\n[Responsible supply chain](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/responsible-supply-chain/)\n\n![Exterior of ATN facility](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ATN-Exterior-resize-crop.jpg?resize=800%2C800)\n\nWithin our facilities\n\nMeeting the highest standards for sustainable buildings\n\n[Data centers](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/data-centers/)\n\n[Offices](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/offices/)\n\n![Happy businesspeople having a discussion during a meeting](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AdobeStock_497220421-crop.jpg?resize=500%2C500)\n\nThroughout our business\n\nWorking together for the highest outcome\n\n[Responsible AI](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/responsible-ai/)\n\n### 2024 Sustainability Report\n\nLearn more about our progress as we work to achieve net zero emissions across our value chain and become water positive in 2030.\n\n[Download the full report](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/asset/2024-sustainability-report/)\n\n![Person kayaking in lake](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kayak.avif?w=1620)\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

With a mission to build the future of social interaction and digital experiences, Meta's strategy encompasses several key areas. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect from Meta in the coming year, explained in simple terms:.\n\n1\\. Expanding the Metaverse\n\nThe metaverse, a virtual reality space where users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users, continues to be Meta\u2019s cornerstone. In 2024, Meta aims to make the metaverse more accessible and immersive. This includes:\n\n- Enhanced VR and AR Experiences: Meta will improve virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, making them more realistic and engaging. Expect new VR headsets and AR glasses with better graphics, sound, and user interfaces.\n- Content Creation and Collaboration: Meta plans to empower users to create and share their own virtual spaces. Think of building your own virtual hangout spot or workspace and inviting friends or colleagues to join you.\n\n2\\. Artificial Intelligence\n\n(AI) will play a crucial role in Meta\u2019s 2024 strategy. Here\u2019s how:\n\n- Personalized User Experience: Meta will use AI to better understand user preferences and tailor content to individual tastes. This means more relevant posts, ads, and suggestions in your feed.\n- Advanced Moderation Tools: AI will help detect and remove harmful content more efficiently, creating a safer online environment for users.\n\n3\\. Enhanced Privacy and Security\n\nIn response to growing concerns about data privacy, Meta is focusing on enhancing user privacy and security.\n\n- Data Protection Initiatives: Meta will introduce more robust data protection measures, giving users greater control over their personal information.\n- Transparent Policies: Expect clearer, more transparent policies regarding how Meta collects and uses data, ensuring users are fully informed and comfortable with their online presence.\n\n4\\. Social Commerce Evolution\n\nMeta is set to revolutionize social commerce, making it easier for businesses and consumers to interact and transact online.\n\n- Seamless Shopping Experience: Integration of shopping features directly into Meta\u2019s platforms (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) will make discovering and purchasing products smoother than ever.\n- Business Tools: Enhanced tools and support for small and medium-sized businesses will help them reach new customers and grow their online presence.\n\n5\\. Global Connectivity\n\nMeta\u2019s vision includes bringing the internet to more people worldwide, focusing on areas with limited access:\n\n- Connectivity Projects: Through initiatives like internet-beaming drones and satellites, Meta aims to provide affordable internet access to remote and underserved regions.\n- Educational Programs: Collaborations with local communities to offer digital literacy programs, helping more people leverage the power of the internet for education and business.\n\n6\\. Sustainability Efforts\n\nMeta is also committed to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint.\n\n- Green Data Centers: Meta will continue to invest in energy-efficient data centers powered by renewable energy.\n- Sustainable Practices: The company aims to implement eco-friendly practices across all its operations, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.\n\nMeta\u2019s strategy for 2024 is all about pushing the boundaries of technology while addressing crucial social issues like privacy, security, and global connectivity. By expanding the metaverse, integrating advanced AI, enhancing privacy protections, evolving social commerce, boosting global connectivity, and committing to sustainability, Meta is set to shape a more connected, innovative, and responsible digital future.\n\nFor those looking to stay ahead in the digital marketing field, understanding these shifts is crucial.

What began as a college networking site quickly blossomed into a global social media powerhouse, connecting billions of people worldwide. From rekindling long-lost friendships to igniting social movements, Meta has redefined how individuals interact. Since those humble beginnings, Zuckerberg has accomplished something extraordinary. Meta is now the seventh-largest publicly traded company in the world, with a market cap of ~$1.2 trillion. Over the years, the company has made around 90 acquisitions, including some of the most significant in history, such as Instagram. The company currently reaches 3.24 billion people daily \u2013 more than 70% of the world's internet users. Join us as we dive deep into the story of Meta.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- **Meta's evolution:** Meta, formerly Facebook, began as a college networking site in 2004 and has grown into one of the largest companies in the world by market cap.\n\n- **Global dominance:** Meta's platforms connect 3.24 billion users daily, making it the by far largest social media company globally.\n\n- **Impressive acquisitions:** Key acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp have strengthened Meta's market position and expanded its influence.\n\n- **Metaverse ambitions:** Meta's rebranding highlights its commitment to leading the future of digital interaction through immersive virtual experiences.\n\n\n## From Social Platform to Metaverse Innovator\n\nOur story begins in 2004, when [Mark Zuckerberg](/insights/business-philosophy/mark-zuckerberg-the-architect-of-social-media) and his Harvard University roommates launched what would evolve into a social media revolution. Originally known as \"TheFacebook,\" it started as a social networking site for Harvard students. Its success led to rapid expansion to other Ivy League schools and eventually to universities worldwide. By the end of 2004, the platform had already started to grow like wildfire beyond the Harvard campus, reaching over 1 million active users.\n\nIn 2005, roughly one year after its launch, the company received its first major investment from [Peter Thiel](/insights/investment-strategy/peter-thiel-shaping-the-next-generation-of-entrepreneurs), co-founder of [PayPal](/companies/paypal-holdings-inc_4096) and the author behind the widely celebrated book \"Zero to One.\" During this time, the name was also changed from TheFacebook to Facebook.\n\nBy 2008, [Meta](/companies/meta-platforms-inc_4109) had surpassed 100 million active users worldwide, fueled by its user-friendly interface and innovative features like the News Feed (2006) and the Like button (2009). This remarkable growth continued in the following years as Meta expanded its global reach and diversified its platforms through acquisitions, such as Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. By this time, roughly 10 years after social media as we know it was invented, Meta was already a clear market leader.\n\nIn October 2021, Meta changed its name from Facebook to reflect its broader ambitions beyond social media. The rebranding signaled the company's focus on building the \"Metaverse,\" a term that refers to a collective virtual shared space that merges physical and digital realities. This includes technologies like VR and AR.\n\nThe name change was part of a strategic shift to emphasize Meta's long-term vision of developing a new digital ecosystem where people can interact, work, play, and connect in virtual environments. Mark Zuckerberg has described the Metaverse as the next evolution of the internet and a central part of the company's future direction. By rebranding, Meta aimed to distance itself from being seen solely as a social media company and instead position itself as a leader in shaping the future of digital interaction. Additionally, the rebranding helped Meta differentiate its corporate identity from the Facebook social media platform, which is now just one of the many products under the Meta umbrella.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, Meta reported a staggering 3.24 billion people using at least one of its core products \u2013 Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger \u2013 every day. This means that over 70% of the world's internet users are engaged with any of Meta's platforms on a daily basis.\n\n![Edge_CTA_cover_1](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1485x523/672c32d934/edge_cta_cover_1.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(85))\n\n![Edge_CTA_cover_1_mobile](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/705x522/3abc861986/edge_cta_cover_1_mobile.png/m/1920x0/filters:quality(85))\n\n**Join 100,000+ other business enthusiasts**\n\n_Sign up for Edge, our free weekly newsletter._\n\n- [Sign up](/edge)\n\n\n## Debunking the Myth: Facebook's Global Relevance\n\nA common misconception about Facebook is that \"no one uses it anymore.\" While it's true that the app might have lost some traction among younger users in certain regions like the Nordics, the global data paints a very different picture.\n\nMeta stopped disclosing the number of users for its individual platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, in its quarterly earnings reports starting in October 2022. Instead, the company began reporting a consolidated number of \"Family of Apps\" daily active people (DAP) and monthly active people (MAP), which include users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. As of Q3 2022, the last time Meta reported individual user numbers for Facebook, it had 1.98 billion DAUs and 2.96 billion MAUs. Contrary to popular belief, these numbers were not declining; in fact, DAUs and MAUs grew by 3% and 2% year-over-year in that quarter.\n\nThis means that over 60% of the approximately 5 billion people connected to the internet globally used Facebook every month as of Q3 2022. Another interesting perspective is the growth in absolute terms: Meta added approximately 70 million daily active users in the last quarter, with DAP increasing from 3.20 billion in Q1 2024 to 3.27 billion in Q2 2024. Meanwhile, platforms like Snapchat and Twitter trailed behind, adding 8 million and 4 million new DAUs and MAUs, respectively.\n\nIn short, Facebook remains one of the fastest-growing social platforms globally, whether its critics like it or not. It's crucial to understand the difference between percentage growth and actual net additions, as the latter often provides a more accurate perspective. With a best-in-class ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) among social platforms at $12.33 and steadily growing, Facebook is far from irrelevant on a global scale.\n\nInterestingly, in many developing countries, people perceive Facebook as synonymous with the internet itself. Studies have shown that more people report using Facebook than the internet, likely due to the platform being pre-installed on many low-cost mobile phones. This makes Facebook the first encounter with the internet for many people, often without them even realizing it.\n\n### The Rise of Facebook Marketplace\n\nAmong Facebook's numerous services, one that stands out is its rapidly growing Marketplace. Launched in response to the popularity of buy-and-sell groups on the platform, Marketplace had over 1 billion users each month, outpacing competitors like [eBay](/companies/ebay-inc_6047) (with around 130 million users). This figure was disclosed by Meta in 2021, but since then, they have not released updated numbers, likely due to increased antitrust scrutiny. It's therefore reasonable to assume that this number is significantly higher today.\n\nThe potential of Marketplace is vast. Its business model, which leverages scale and network effects to achieve high margins, has proven incredibly lucrative for other companies like [Rightmove](/companies/rightmove-plc_11370) and eBay, both of which enjoy FCF margins of 55% and 20%, respectively. Although Facebook only began monetizing and enhancing Marketplace in 2018, the service is arguably still in its early stages.\n\n### Instagram: Facebook's Crown Jewel\n\nFacebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012, just a month before its $104 billion IPO, is often lauded as one of the best acquisitions in history. Facebook purchased Instagram for $1 billion at a time when the photo-sharing app had only 30 million users and had never generated any revenue.\n\nToday, while the exact number of Instagram's MAUs remains somewhat secretive \u2013 likely due to antitrust considerations \u2013 it's estimated to have around 2.4 billion MAUs, with an annual growth rate of 10-15%.\n\nInstagram's demographics are particularly appealing: over 70% of its users are under 35, and the average user spends more than 30 minutes per day on the app. The user base is also evenly split between men and women. Officially, Instagram ranks as the third most popular app ever measured by MAUs, following Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nFor those who argue that Facebook is losing relevance, Instagram offers a compelling counterpoint. Unlike The Blue App, Instagram seems far from reaching its peak in terms of monetization, product development, or user engagement, making it the true jewel in Facebook's portfolio.\n\n### WhatsApp: A Super App in the Making?\n\nAnother exciting component of Facebook's ecosystem is WhatsApp, especially in developing countries where mobile phone and internet connectivity often lag behind. With over 2 billion users, about 500 million in India and another 100-150 million in Brazil, WhatsApp is poised to become a critical player in these markets.\n\nMeta for instance launched WhatsApp Pay in late 2020, allowing users to make payments and transfer money directly within the app, a feature reminiscent of [Tencent's](/companies/tencent-holdings-limited_4663) WeChat. Given its integration with Facebook Shops and the forthcoming CRM tool Kustomer, WhatsApp is evolving into a super app with significant potential.\n\nZuckerberg has previously revealed that the WhatsApp Business API already sends over 100 million messages per day, indicating the app's substantial scale on the B2B side. The long-term vision for WhatsApp is becoming clearer as more pieces of the puzzle fall into place each quarter.\n\n### The Metaverse\n\nMost tech enthusiasts are now familiar with Meta\u2019s ambitious vision for the Metaverse, a virtual universe that aims to blend physical and digital realities in unprecedented ways. Since rebranding from Facebook to Meta in 2021, the company has shifted significant focus towards developing this expansive virtual environment, which is envisioned to encompass gaming, social interaction, work, and entertainment.\n\nMark Zuckerberg has expressed high hopes for the Metaverse, with around 17% (or 10,000) of Meta\u2019s employees now dedicated to virtual and augmented reality. The company is not only developing its own Metaverse platform but also acquiring studios and expertise in AR/VR to support this vision.\n\nIn various interviews, Zuckerberg has passionately discussed how Meta is leveraging its existing VR technology as a foundation for the Metaverse. This includes using VR for virtual meetings and social interactions, which Meta has already started to implement.\n\nZuckerberg has been cautious when discussing Meta's potential as a dominant \"App Store player\" within the Metaverse, likely due to ongoing antitrust scrutiny. However, his clear intention to build an interconnected virtual ecosystem suggests that Meta sees the Metaverse as a central component of its future growth.\n\nThe Meta Quest 2, formerly known as Oculus Quest 2, is being positioned as one of the first mainstream gateways to the Metaverse, offering users immersive experiences that go beyond traditional gaming. The \"Other\" revenue category, which includes Metaverse-related ventures, has shown significant growth, indicating increasing consumer and developer interest in Meta's vision. As the global AR/VR market is projected to grow rapidly, Meta's focus on the Metaverse is seen as a strategic move that could reshape how people interact with digital content, making it a trend worth watching for both tech enthusiasts and investors alike.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs Meta continues to evolve from a social media giant to a pioneer in the digital frontier, its journey reflects the audacious vision of its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. What began in a Harvard dorm room as a simple college networking site has grown into a global powerhouse, reshaping how the world communicates and interacts. With its rebranding in 2021, Meta signaled its ambition to lead the next era of digital interaction through the Metaverse, aiming to create immersive, interconnected virtual experiences, the result from this remains to be seen. As it navigates the complexities of this new digital frontier, Meta's story is likely far from over \u2013 perhaps it's just beginning.\n\n### Have you tried the Quartr mobile app?\n\nGet free access to live earnings calls, transcripts, analyst estimates, and more\n\n- [Get the app](/download)\n\n- [Learn more](/products/mobile-app)\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n[![The World\u2019s Top CEOs](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1344x756/b1eb05ff09/top-ceo.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(85))\\\\\n\\\\\nThe World\u2019s Top CEOs: Lessons in Excellence\\\\\n\\\\\nIn today\u2019s competitive corporate landscape, CEOs are the rudders guiding companies to success.

As of December 2024, Meta's market capitalization stands at approximately $1.48 trillion, making it the [world's 7th most valuable company](https://companiesmarketcap.com/meta-platforms/marketcap/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). With a market capitalization surpassing $1 trillion as of 2024 and over [3 billion monthly active users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) across its platforms, Meta\u2019s influence is undeniably strong. But this success isn\u2019t just driven by its widespread social media reach or its ambitious Metaverse vision. Here's an inside look at Meta\u2019s financial growth journey and how the company is revolutionizing the digital economy.\n\n### The Early Expansions\n\nMeta's journey toward global tech dominance began with its public debut in 2012, raising $16 billion in an IPO that valued the company at $104 billion. By the end of that year, [Facebook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebook-reaches-1-billion-users/2012/10/04/5edfefb2-0e14-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_story.html) (before merging into Meta) had surpassed 1 billion users. In the following years, Facebook's growth was driven by strategic acquisitions, such as [Instagram](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/) for $1 billion in 2012, strengthening its presence in photo-sharing, and [WhatsApp](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/10/06/facebook-closes-19-billion-whatsapp-deal/) for $19 billion in 2014, expanding its mobile messaging capabilities. These acquisitions set the stage for the rebranding of Facebook's virtual reality division as \"Facebook Reality Labs\" in 2016, reflecting a growing commitment to AR and VR technologies. As Zuckerberg began to focus on the long-term potential of the Metaverse, Meta committed to pouring over $10 billion into [Meta\u2019s Reality Labs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse) division, positioning it at the forefront of the next wave of internet innovation.\n\n### The Stock and Investor Surge\n\nDue to Meta\u2019s impressive long-term growth potential as a leading AI tech company, investors have been flocking to the strategically restructured company. [Analysts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/10/whats-behind-the-80-rise-in-meta-stock/) noted that Meta\u2019s combination of AI-powered advertising tools and its growth in immersive technologies make it a compelling investment, thus resulting in a [80% stock increase](https://investor.atmeta.com/home/default.aspx) in 2024. Additionally, Meta\u2019s commitment to enhancing its [AR/VR hardware](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/how-meta-is-dominating-the-ar-vr-market-amid-global-demand) and software has placed it at the forefront of the immersive technology industry. Looking ahead, Meta\u2019s stock is expected to average around [$697.66](https://coincodex.com/stock/META/price-prediction/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in 2025, which is a 19% increase compared to the company\u2019s stock price in 2024. Meta's strong financial performance and positive analyst forecasts have significantly enhanced investor confidence, positioning the company for continued success in the evolving digital landscape.\n\n### The Advertising Juggernaut\n\nDespite Meta\u2019s growing focus on the Metaverse, its advertising business remains the core of its revenue model. By utilizing their digital advertising platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp, Meta is able to provide advertisers hyper-targeted ads across diverse demographics, which is key to its success. Despite challenges from big competitors like [Google and Tiktok,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/10/whats-behind-the-80-rise-in-meta-stock/) Meta\u2019s advertising revenue exceeded [$130 billion](https://investor.atmeta.com/financials/) in 2024, solidifying its position as a leading player in the global digital advertising market. This advertising strength continues to be the primary driver of Meta's financial growth, even as it pushes into new frontiers like the Metaverse and immersive digital experiences. As long as Meta can continue to innovate and provide value to advertisers, its advertising business will remain a critical pillar of its overall strategy.\n\nMeta's journey offers valuable lessons for businesses in any industry, especially when it comes to staying ahead of digital trends and diversifying revenue streams. By strategically diversifying its revenue streams and heavily investing in emerging technologies, Meta has positioned itself at the forefront of the digital economy. The company's robust 2024 performance, with a [19% year-over-year revenue increase](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/14/ai-powers-metas-strong-q3-growth-profits-soar/), highlights its resilience despite significant investments in new sectors. Additionally, their confidence in the Metaverse fostered a strong investment source, serving as reminder for B2B companies to prioritize long-term growth initiatives. By embracing these strategies, growth-seeking companies can not only survive but thrive in an increasingly digital and competitive landscape.\n\nAs a leading tech platform, Cake assists professionals looking to break through the startup scene and experienced startups searching for potential growth expansion strategies.
