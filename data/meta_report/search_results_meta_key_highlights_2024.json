      "markdown": "\n\n[Back to Newsroom](https://about.fb.com/news)\n\nMeta\n\nDecember 27, 2024January 7, 2025\n\n![](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-EOY-Recap_Header.jpg)\n\nAs 2024 concludes, we\u2019re looking back at the products, updates and initiatives that marked a year of innovation at Meta. This was a year of pushing our products forward while adding helpful new features and working to keep people safe across our platforms.\n\nThese highlights provide a quick overview of some of the year\u2019s biggest accomplishments as we gear up for 2025.\n\n## Looking Forward With Open Source AI, Orion and More\n\n[![A drawing of glasses facing charts and graphs](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Orion.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Orion.png) In 2024, we introduced [Meta AI](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-ai-assistant-built-with-llama-3/), an AI assistant that we believe to be the most advanced one available for free.\n\n[![A drawing of a human-like Llama wearing glasses and a blue scarf](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Llama.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Llama.png)\n\nBuilt using Llama, our open source AI model, Meta AI can be used across Meta\u2019s apps to help you get things done, learn, create and connect with the things and people that matter to you. It can help you plan a trip, study and more, and it\u2019s on track to be the world\u2019s most used AI assistant by the end of the year, with nearly 600 million monthly active users.\n\nEarlier this year, our Founder & CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, [wrote an open letter](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/) about open source AI\u2019s potential to effect meaningful change. With more than 650 million downloads, Llama has become a popular choice in the open source community. [![A drawing of a planet that looks like Saturn](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Threads-Fediverse.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_Threads-Fediverse.png) We\u2019ve seen [companies employing Llama](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/how-companies-are-using-meta-llama/) to build technology for the public good, from [localizing educational material](https://ai.meta.com/blog/foondamate-study-aid-education-llama/) to [increasing access to medical information](https://ai.meta.com/blog/bimedix-built-with-llama/) in low-resource communities.\n\nIn addition to AI, we made industry-leading advancements in AR when we introduced [Orion](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/), our first true AR glasses prototype, a key part of our vision to build the next computing platform that puts people at the center so they can be more present, connected and empowered in the world. [![A drawing of a planet highlighting different server locations on different continents](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Expansion.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Expansion.png) We also released [Meta Quest 3S](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/meta-quest-3s-our-most-affordable-mixed-reality-headset/), our most affordable mixed reality headset yet, and brought to market new styles and smart features for [Ray-Ban Meta glasses](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/ray-ban-meta-glasses-new-ai-features-and-partner-integrations/), like helping you remember where you parked and answering questions based on what you\u2019re looking at.\n\nAnd we made significant progress integrating Threads into the [fediverse](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/what-is-the-fediverse/), a global social network of interoperable servers.\n\n## Adding the Features You Asked For\n\n[![A drawing of a storefront](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_WA-Conversations.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_WA-Conversations.png)\n\nWe\u2019re always looking to enhance your experience across our family of apps by adding features that continually raise the bar, and this year was no different.\u00a0[![A drawing of a woman surrounded by objects/symbols of different technological functions, including a coffee cup and a light bulb](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Assistant.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/01_Innovation_AI-Assistant.png)\n\nFor WhatsApp, we [improved call quality](https://www.instagram.com/metanewsroom/p/DDfDAW-RkNA/) and made in-group calling more flexible, plus we introduced [enhanced AI features](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/new-ai-tools-meta-verified-and-more-for-businesses-on-whatsapp/) for business chats and a new way to [schedule events](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/events-in-whatsapp-communities/). Over on Threads, we added exciting new [web features](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/08/new-threads-features-for-creators-and-businesses/) to help businesses and creators get the most out of the platform \u2013 insights, post scheduling and multiple drafts.\n\n[![A drawing of a light bulb](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_Threads-Insights.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_Threads-Insights.png)We also focused on making sure your experience on Instagram reflects you \u2013 who you are, what you want to see and what you create.\n\n[![An illustration of the Facebook logo surrounded by symbols of interactivity, including a painter's palette and a bicycle](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_FBIRL.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_FBIRL.png) In addition to features allowing you to [edit DMs and pin chats](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/03/instagram-dm-updates/), we introduced new [ways to connect](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/new-ways-to-connect-through-dms/) through Instagram DMs, including nicknames and location sharing, making Instagram an even more vibrant place to connect.\n\n[![An illustration of photographs symbolizing Instagram surrounded by several symbols of different functions a user might add to their algorithm, for instance a musical note](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Stickers.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Stickers.png)\n\nWe know people want to be able to shape their experience on Instagram as their interests and passions change, which is why we started testing a new way to [reset the recommendations](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/introducing-recommendations-reset-instagram/) you see on Instagram\u2019s Explore, Reels and Feed. And for creators, Instagram\u2019s new [trial reels](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/12/trial-reels-try-content-non-followers-first-see-what-perfoms-best/) let creators show your reels to non-followers first to test how they perform.\n\n## Keeping Our Platforms Safe\n\n[![A drawing of a teen surrounded by symbols of interactivity, communication and safety, for instance a lock and Meta's chat-bubble symbol for messaging](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Teen-Accounts-1.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Teen-Accounts-1.png)\n\nIn 2024, we stayed vigilant about security and safety, adapting our platforms for an evolving digital landscape.\n\nWe introduced Instagram [Teen Accounts](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/), giving teens built-in protections which limit who can contact them and the content they see. [![An illustration of a paintbrush painting white over a number of different scenes, such as a living room](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Reccomendation-Reset.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/02_FOA_IG-Reccomendation-Reset.png) We [launched a new education campaign](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/instagram-campaign-protect-teens-sextortion-scams) to help teens and parents spot sextortion scams and we [collaborated with](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/preventing-suicide-and-self-harm-content-spreading-online/) experts and peers to help prevent the spread of suicide and self-harm content online.\n\nTo help stop celeb-bait ads and speed up account recovery, we began [testing facial recognition technology](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/testing-combat-scams-restore-compromised-accounts/). [![A smartphone showing different functions as physical buttons, like a video camera and the chat/Messenger icon](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Messenger-E2EE-1-e1735066121158.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Messenger-E2EE-1-e1735066121158.png) This innovative, easy verification method ensures the right person accesses the right account. And we\u2019re protecting communications between you and the people important to you. [![](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Facial-Rec-1.png?w=150&h=150&crop=1&resize=220%2C220)](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/03_Safety_Facial-Rec-1.png)[End-to-end encryption](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/03/end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger-explained/) on Messenger secures your conversations by making it so that nobody sees them except you and the people you\u2019re messaging with.\n\nWe spent 2024 innovating, updating and protecting \u2013 pushing technology forward while keeping your experience secure. It was a strong year, and we\u2019re excited for the next one.\n\n* * *\n\nCategories\n\n:\n\n[Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technologies/meta/ )[Technology and Innovation](https://about.fb.com/news/category/technology-and-innovation/ )\n\nTags:\n\n[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/)[Community Standards and Enforcement](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/community-standards-and-enforcement/)[Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)[Ray-Ban Meta Glasses](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/ray-ban-meta-glasses/)[Safety](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/safety/)[Scams](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/scams/)[Virtual Reality](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/virtual-reality/)[Well-Being](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/well-being/)\n\n* * *\n\n## Related News\n\nTo help personalize content, tailor and measure ads, and provide a safer experience, we use cookies.

The company surveyed top executives to understand industry outlooks and identify crucial areas for business growth. The Meta IT experts, Marcos Machado (Managing Director) and Simone Lettieri (CDO), were joined by other influential figures in the industry such as Gustavo Franca (Global CIO at [Gerdau](https://www2.gerdau.com/)), Alexandre Villeroy (CIO at [Acelen](https://ri.acelen.com.br/en/the-company/corporate-profile/)), Helio Matsumoto (CIO at Sicredi), Alexandre Telles (CIO at [Ajinomoto](https://www.ajinomoto.com/)), Lilian Hoffmann (Executive Director of Technologies and Innovation at BP), and Wanderley Baccala (Digital Hub Executive Director at Globo).\n\nThe report, accessible on their website [https://metait.ai/tech-trends-2024/](/tech-trends-2024/), highlights eight key trends shaping the year. Here\u2019s a quick overview of each:\n\n## More than just transformation, digital evolution\n\nThere is an ongoing need for continuous improvement. It\u2019s not just about efficiency, but also driving better experiences for both employees and customers. Digital evolution goes beyond technology, encompassing cultural and organizational shifts focused on people.\n\n\u201cEmbracing relevant trends and efficiently integrating them into daily operations is essential. Digital evolution represents a conscious and strategic journey towards tangible results, not just a passing trend,\u201d explains Marcos Machado, Managing Director at Meta IT.\n\n## The year of operational efficiency\n\n2024 is the year of operational efficiency; after all, adopting solutions that enable a company\u2019s evolution is important, but what truly makes a difference is not about having cutting-edge technology, but rather being aligned with customer needs and having an organizational culture compatible with the use of these technologies, fully leveraging them. The goal is to [streamline operations](/production-planning-sap/), maximize resource utilization, and ultimately [support a long-term evolutionary strategy](/solucoes/digital-strategy/).\n\n## Increasingly intelligent artificial intelligence\n\nFollowing a strong 2023, [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](/solucoes/process-automation-optimization/) remains a major focus. The report highlights its potential for driving experimentation, new opportunities, and innovation through generative AI, which can create original content and learn complex patterns.\n\n\u201cCompanies continue to recognize the role of technology as a facilitator in addressing business challenges that impact business, social, and environmental issues. In other words, innovations will not replace, but rather demand adaptation and improvement of human functions,\u201d emphasizes Simone Lettieri, CDO at Meta IT.\n\n## Digital Twins, the best of both worlds\n\n\u201cDigital twins\u201d are real-time virtual representations of physical objects or processes that allow for precise simulations and optimization, like in equipment operation. According to data from Grand View Research, the global market for this technology is expected to exceed $25 billion in revenue by 2025.\n\n## Automating processes means making work easier\n\n[Process automation](/solucoes/process-automation-optimization/) is about making people\u2019s work easier, but it is not just about that. The benefits of automation go far beyond, resulting in noticeable precision, with reduced errors and greater agility in task performance. It goes hand-in-hand with process optimization to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and meet customer demands.\n\n## The transformative power of quantum computing\n\nQuantum computing combines aspects of computing, physics, and mathematics, using quantum mechanics to solve complex problems much faster than traditional computers. There are already some promising applications of quantum computing that simulate supercomputers in commercial use with a focus on logistic optimization.\n\n## It\u2019s all about people, culture, work, and performance\n\nCompanies with higher digital maturity tend to invest more in automation and innovation that facilitates work. This is because [they have a culture that embraces technology](/hr-role-digital-transformation/), allowing employees and customers to collaborate more effectively.\n\n\u201cAt Meta IT, we believe digital transformation thrives on putting people first. Technology is our tool, but it\u2019s the human factor that unlocks its potential. This collaborative approach fuels operational efficiency and drives growth for our clients,\u201d concludes Marcos Machado, Managing Director at Meta IT.\n\nReady to learn about the latest tech trends beyond just AI?

Packed with reveals, updates, demonstrations, and some AI magic, Meta pulled out the stops to show the world what they\u2019re working on.\n\nSo, we at SideQuest have rounded up the 7key highlights from Meta Connect 2024 that we think you need to know about!\n\n# 1\\. Quest 3S launch\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*VDUf0y8xEa-7WfRrvVUQhA.png)\n\nLess than 2 minutes into the keynote presentation, Mark Zuckerberg revealed the Quest 3S\u2014 [possibly the most important VR headset launch in 2024](https://medium.com/sidequestvr/quest-3s-could-be-the-most-important-vr-headset-of-2024-4b8da943692a).\n\nWith [preorders](https://www.meta.com/gb/quest/quest-3s/) going live as soon as the keynote ended, the Quest 3S presents a more budget-friendly version of the flagship Quest 3 and will launch on **October 15** with prices starting at **$299** for the 128GB model and rising to **$399** for the 256GB model.\n\nAdditionally, all preorders and post-launch purchases (until announced otherwise) will come with a **3-month free trial of** [**Meta\u2019s Quest+** **subscription service**](https://www.meta.com/gb/meta-quest-plus/) and a free copy of the hotly anticipated [**Batman: Arkham Shadow**](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/). Additionally, if you [order Quest 3S through Meta](https://www.meta.com/gb/quest/quest-3s/), you\u2019ll get a **1-year limited warranty** on the device and its boxed contents.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*Eq12DgyqBffLHGfm.png)\n\nA comparison between pancake lenses found in the Quest 3 (left) and fresnel lenses found in Quest 2 and Quest 3S (right).\n\nRegarding specifications, the Quest 3S is similar to its bigger brother, the Quest 3, while including older elements from Quest 2 to keep the price low (looking at you, fresnel lenses!). However, the other specifications, including the all-important Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and 8GB RAM, are the same as those found in Quest 3. This means Quest 3S can play all the same apps and games as Quest 3\u2014including the same Mixed Reality experiences. Plus, almost all Quest 3 accessories from Meta and third-party suppliers, such as head straps and facial interfaces, will also fit the Quest 3S.\n\nWith Quest 3S now available from just $299, this could be the perfect time to upgrade from Quest 2 if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s a great-value deal for newcomers to VR as well\u2014or if you have another family member who wants to get into VR or play with you in local co-op. And, since the Quest 2 launched at the same price back in 2020 and went on to sell over 20 million units worldwide, we\u2019re confident that the Quest 3S will perform well\u2014and provide more users around the world with the most up-to-date standalone VR experiences and features.\n\n[You can read more about our thoughts on the Quest 3S right here](https://medium.com/sidequestvr/quest-3s-could-be-the-most-important-vr-headset-of-2024-4b8da943692a).\n\n# 2\\. Quest 3 price cut\u2014and discontinued 128GB model\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*bZ39lJpDLfSyDuJ-hx4aIg.png)\n\nCoinciding with the Quest 3S launch, Meta also dropped the RRP of the Quest 3 512GB model to just **$499.** Meanwhile, they have ceased shipping the 128GB model altogether.\n\nThe Quest 3 ecosystem now comprises:\n\n- 128GB Quest 3S ($299)\n- 256GB Quest 3S ($399)\n- 512GB Quest 3 ($499)\n\nNot only is this a nice, even pricing structure, it also means that the Quest 3 and Quest 3S are perhaps the best value standalone VR headsets on the market right now\u2014especially at the lowest and highest ends. These are both fantastic headsets, and Meta\u2019s competitors are probably rethinking their own pricing strategies as a result.\n\nThere\u2019s never been a better time to get into VR with such fantastic prices-to-value!\n\n# 3\\. Orion Augmented Reality glasses\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*yYK6TA17YJcUloZ5QJdNnA.png)\n\nPerhaps the highlight of the keynote address was the unexpectedly in-depth prototype reveal of [Meta\u2019s Orion AR glasses](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/orion)\u2014perhaps the most advanced pair of glasses the world has ever seen.\n\nFrom the outside, they look like any ordinary pair of (thicc) glasses, weighing only 98g and paired with a sleek black wristband and wireless puck (without which, the glasses will not work). However, there\u2019s a lot of technical wonder going on under the hood.\n\nThey were designed from the ground up to make communication and connection more accessible and fun, help you with daily tasks, play games, and be genuinely smart thanks to AI integration\u2014all while being genuinely comfortable and stylish to wear.\n\nIn Full: Mark Zuckerberg Reveals \"Orion\" Prototype AR Glasses - YouTube\n\nUploadVR\n\n92.9K subscribers\n\n[In Full: Mark Zuckerberg Reveals \"Orion\" Prototype AR Glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPLWIL64sgQ)\n\nUploadVR\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

When the time comes and Orion\u2019s consumer-ready successor goes on sale\u2014likely sometime in the next few years\u2014they might just accomplish that dream.\n\n[You can read more of our thoughts on Meta\u2019s Orion AR glasses right here](https://medium.com/sidequestvr/meta-unveils-orion-their-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses-23923badd528).\n\n# 4\\. Meta AI\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Yx3eGwWy7gaaFSP4-y0fbw.png)\n\nAI is all the rage these days\u2014and [Meta is no exception](https://ai.meta.com/). In fact, Connect 2024 focused on AI more than anything else, with the technology being mentioned in every segment of the keynote address and cropping up across many of the smaller talks and showcases over the 2 days. While it feels like a bit of a buzzword in tech\u2014and has done for a few years now\u2014Meta is actually doing some pretty cool (or creepy, depending on your outlook) stuff with AI\u2014especially in the wearables field\u2014that we need to talk about.\n\n## Total AI integration\n\nThis isn\u2019t \u2018new\u2019 news, but Meta is really pushing the power of AI across all of its platforms and products, especially in the form of its AI assistant, which is now powered by the [updated Llama 3.2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/)\u2014Meta\u2019s own LLM (Language Learning Model).\n\nTheir AI assistant is now fully integrated into WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, the latest generation of their Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and, of course, Quest headsets. You can ask it questions in real-time and, using your device and data, it will make recommendations depending on what you ask. Classic AI assistant stuff, then.\n\n## Better vocal interaction\n\nSlightly more impressive is the work Meta has been doing to improve vocal interactions with their AI assistant and make it feel more natural. They\u2019ve even gone so far as to add celebrity voices to its AI chatbots, including Awkwafina, John Cena, and even Dame Judi Dench if you prefer a touch of British sophistication.\n\nWith Mark Zuckerberg himself believing that vocal interaction with AI is far more natural than text and presents the future of the tech\u2019s development, these additions and updates are unsurprising.\n\n## Image interpretation\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*P2-OQ3MdF46B9TVJek2fbg.png)\n\nMore impressive, still, is their work on AI image interpretation, with the software able to recognize (in many cases) what you\u2019re looking at and answer questions based on what it sees\u2014amongst other things.\n\nThese updates pair perfectly with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest headsets\u2014and actually have a wide range of intriguing applications. You can look at an outfit laid out on your bed and ask how it would be accessorized. You can look at an animal and ask it for information about that animal. You can even look at your parking spot (if it\u2019s numbered) and ask the AI to remember where you parked for you.\n\nDuring the Orion glasses showcase, Meta also demonstrated the AI\u2019s powers of recognition by letting it scan a group of ingredients and then provide recommendations on what to cook. The days of staring blankly at the fridge are over, it seems! Apparently, they\u2019re also working on instant translation, so you won\u2019t get stuck ordering off a foreign menu, either.\n\nThis power of image recognition also extends to image editing. Since the AI (broadly speaking) knows what it\u2019s looking at, you can ask it to make changes and tweaks to images, too.\n\nTo allay any fears that this image recognition might be getting a bit too Black Mirror, Meta has stated that its recognition software will not work on humans. You won\u2019t be able to track or recognize individuals. This is evidently due to (well-considered) safety and security concerns.\n\nBut, while this is impressive, none of this is exactly \u2018new stuff\u2019.\n\n## Automatic video dubbing and live translation\n\nWhat is new\u2014and will surely come in very handy\u2014is the ability for AI to detect the original language of a reel or short-form video and dub it into your native language\u2014including an approximation of lip-synch. They\u2019re currently only experimenting with English and Spanish, but the demo was impressive and showcased the AI\u2019s ability to make an accurate dub, even when the content was spoken at speed.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*qkPzvDW4Zv91vEQz9Vobvg.png)\n\nYou may soon be able to break language barriers with AI.\n\nThese translation developments will even extend to live conversations over time\u2014as was also demonstrated during the keynote address. Zuckerberg was able to have a back-and-forth conversation in Spanish and English with a native speaker using the AI model integrated into the Ray-Bans they were both wearing. This is impressive stuff.\n\n## AI impersonation\u2026\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*gkak_ii0P2QAjd4wKiv-Aw.png)\n\nYeah\u2026 That\u2019s an AI.\n\nA final new feature (and definitely broke into Black Mirror territory\u2014for me at least) was their new AI face generation, as demonstrated by Don Allen Stevenson III and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nNot only have they trained the AI model to impersonate Stevenson to help respond to DMs, emails, and more in his written style, they\u2019ve fed it data on what he is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014knowledgeable about so that it can provide more \u2018Stevenson-accurate\u2019 responses based on his real-life skills and experience. He knows a lot about writing and tech, but not so much about mountain climbing, as was demonstrated.\n\nBut the kicker was when Zuckerberg hopped onto a \u2018video call\u2019 with an AI representation of Stevenson and had it answer no only in his voice, but with his speaking style and subtle movements\u2014and an approximation of his real-life knowledge, too.\n\nThis is cool. But it\u2019s also really creepy.\n\n# 5\\. Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses updates\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*aunxQ1IOI6RmWp0ZhgTNog.png)\n\n[Meta\u2019s collab with Ray-Ban](https://meta.com/gb/smart-glasses/shop-all/?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=ps&utm_campaign=20687046214&utm_term=meta+ray+bans&utm_content=714820859989&utm_funnel=dcap&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwgfm3BhBeEiwAFfxrG7pPs9bxcg7Txh6NMAoq_Nsml5PElXjeZUEidyRApRAsQLtkYM7rAhoC6mEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) has produced some pretty awesome, functional, and fashionable wearables so far\u2014with AI integration, video and photo cameras, and audio features that we\u2019ve been loving, alongside the ability to answer calls and texts\u2014and even get navigation assistance! And they\u2019re getting better still!\n\nA lot of these coming improvements will be in line with the AI advancements we\u2019ve already discussed above, but let\u2019s just summarize with: We can soon expect active recording, image, and object recognition, live translations, and more.\n\nMeta\u2019s AI integration with Ray-Bans has also expanded the app selection it\u2019s compatible with \u2014 especially when it comes to audio. If you\u2019re not a Spotify fan, you can also link up with Amazon Music, Audible, and more \u2014 with more promised over time.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Q314qNlGsRoORmh5_y6fSw.png)\n\nLimited edition clear frames Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nAdditionally, earlier product runs were difficult to get with transition lenses, but now there is a wider range available to suit your style, whether you want more traditional glasses or full-on shades. They\u2019re also releasing a limited \u2018clear frames\u2019 edition of the glasses.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not actually tried these smart glasses yet, we\u2019d recommend that you do! Alongside the fact that they\u2019re cool and stylish glasses you\u2019d want to wear anyway, the functionality of these things is actually useful and may well represent the future of wearables.\n\n# 6\\. Developers to be given access to camera passthrough API\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*8vJ940ycVdyV1intF8BbZw.png)\n\nWe\u2019re always excited by any reveal geared towards supporting developers\u2014and this one could be key for the future of app development in passthrough!\n\nWell, it appears Meta will finally be [granting developers access to their latest camera passthrough API](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculusdev/comments/1fq33l6/new_camera_passthrough_api_to_allow_some_amount/) (Application Programming Interface) from early next year, opening the doors to better apps and game development for Quest headsets.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear what form this will take, or how extensive this access will be, many developers will benefit from this as Meta has historically been very tight about camera access on Quest headsets due to privacy concerns.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to see Meta make a move showing they care about developer feedback!\n\n# 7\\. New Horizon avatars\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*FZzIVrUUHkXNjpqkSg9DDA.png)\n\nOut with the old and in with the new\u2014Meta\u2019s Horizon avatars are finally getting [the visual upgrade we\u2019ve been waiting for since 2022](https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-avatars-legs-graphics-overhaul/)!\n\nWhile introducing legs to their avatars was a popular move, there\u2019s always been something a little too \u2018uncanny valley\u2019 about the Horizon avatars. They were stiff. Not human enough. Not customizable enough. And I don\u2019t look anything like mine\u2026\n\nWell, now they\u2019re getting\u2026 better!?\n\nWith this [latest update](https://medium.com/sidequestvr/new-meta-vr-avatars-to-be-announced-at-meta-connect-2024-8615b053c5f9), Meta has made improvements to the avatars\u2019 visual style and included a suite of new options to help you fine-tune your look more than ever before. A particularly welcome change is greater control over body proportions\u2014something that the older avatars were severely lacking. Many of the options now include sliders so you have more control over your appearance, so your avatar should look more distinctive than ever before.\n\nHaving played around with it myself (and you can try it too by visiting the Horizon app now!), I like the changes, however, I wish there had been more updates to the wardrobe and hair options. The wardrobe is mostly the same as before, while the hair options (and especially facial hair) just leave much to be desired.\n\nIs it as good as the character creator in Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 or the latest Dragon Age? Absolutely not. But it\u2019s better than the old one, and you should have fun playing with it!\n\n# But, what about the games?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*sP0Z3y0hKpxwvrfQg2rr9A.png)\n\nMeta Connect 2024 was an AI-first event. While we got hands-on demos of the new Quest 3S and\u2014perhaps even more exciting\u2014the Orion AR glasses, the keynote, in particular, was really a showcase of Meta\u2019s AI advancements, what it can do, and how it is helping them build the future of wearable tech.\n\nIn particular, we can\u2019t wait to get hands-on with the live translation AI features\u2014being a global company, this will definitely come in handy at SideQuest! We\u2019re also very keen to follow the development of the Orion AR glasses\u2014hopefully, we\u2019ll have some consumer-ready products on the market sometime in the next 3 years!\n\nIn terms of games, there was a healthy buzz about upcoming apps and games launching before the end of 2024. With Quest 3S capable of running the same titles as Quest 3, anyone upgrading can look forward to more than [Batman: Arkham Shadow](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/)! We\u2019ve also got [Metro Awakening](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/metro-awakening-deluxe-edition/5096918017089406/) (November) and [Alien: Rogue Incursion](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/alien-rogue-incursion/24882487241367228/) (December) poised to deliver some thrilling chills. And you can play the newly-released [Starship Home](https://sidequestvr.com/app/38071/starship-home) right now, which is a very cozy title built entirely for Mixed Reality! You won\u2019t find any of these on Quest 2!\n\nHowever, regardless of these amazing games coming up, one thing we found lacking throughout the event was any news on developer visibility on the Horizon Store.\n\nSure, there were several presentations and demos geared towards assisting developers\u2014and granting developers access to their new camera passthrough API from early next year\u2014but we didn't get any updates on the state of the transition away from App Lab and how indie developers may be able to get more traction on the Horizon Store.\n\nSince App Lab was discontinued, developers were optimistic about Horizon Store restrictions relaxing, believing there would finally be a greater level of discovery for early access titles on the official storefront. However, this has not been the case and many developers we\u2019re in conversation with are incredibly frustrated by this\u2014and the lack of communication around it. Especially considering Meta seems to be promoting Horizon Worlds more than any other app right now\u2014just look at the Horizon Store homepage!\n\nWe hope they address this soon.\n\nOtherwise\u2026 What a show! We\u2019ve got loads to look forward to over the next year (and beyond)\u2014and plenty more adventures to have in eXtended Reality!\n\n# About SideQuest\n\nSideQuest is the ultimate community in standalone VR.

[Source](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/1525382954801931/)\n\nIn a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1525382954801931&vanity=zuck) posted on Facebook and [text](https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DEhgZJYJu5D) posted to Threads, today Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced sweeping changes to the company's approach to content moderation. After years of developing 'trust and safety' and content moderation systems and policies, Zuckerberg now asserts that \"we've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship.\" Zuckerberg has decided to return to a posture that he believes will prioritize free expression.\n\nSpecific policy changes announced include:\n\n- Eliminating fact-checkers in the US and replacing them with a \"community notes\" system similar to X (formerly Twitter);\n- \"Simplifying\" content policies by removing certain restrictions on topics like immigration and gender;\n- Changing enforcement approach for policy violations:\n  - Focusing automated filters only on illegal and high-severity violations;\n  - Requiring user reports before taking action on lower-severity violations;\n  - Increasing the confidence threshold required before removing content;\n  - Reintroducing civic and political content into recommendation systems on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads;\n  - Relocating trust and safety and content moderation teams from California to Texas. \"This will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Threads.\n\nZuckerberg says he is planning to work with President-elect Donald Trump to oppose global \"censorship\" pressures. He makes claims about such pressures mounting in multiple regions, including:\n\n- Europe's \"ever-increasing number of laws, institutionalizing censorship\";\n- Secret courts in Latin America that \"that can order companies to quietly take things down\";\n- Chinese censorship.\n\nHe further claims that the only way Meta \"can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government, and that's why it's been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship.\"\n\nZuckerberg's statement was timed with the [release of a post](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/) by Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan:\n\n> We want to undo the mission creep that has made our rules too restrictive and too prone to over-enforcement. We\u2019re getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate. It\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.\n\nNotably, Kaplan says the company is now deploying \"AI large language models (LLMs) to provide a second opinion on some content before we take enforcement actions.\"\n\nTimed with the announcement, Kaplan also provided an \"exclusive\" [interview](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/meta-ends-fact-checking-program-zuckerberg-vows-restore-free-expression-facebook-instagram) with the Fox News morning program \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\n_Below is a transcript of Zuckerberg's remarks, followed by a transcript of the Kaplan appearance on Fox & Friends:_\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg:**\n\nHey everyone. I want to talk about something important today because it's time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram. I started building social media to give people a voice. I gave a speech at Georgetown five years ago about the importance of protecting free expression, and I still believe this today, but a lot has happened over the last several years.\n\nThere's been widespread debate about the potential harms from online content. Governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more. A lot of this is clearly political, but there's also a lot of legitimately bad stuff out there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation. These are things that we take very seriously, and I want to make sure that we handle responsibly. So we built a lot of complex systems to moderate content, but the problem with complex systems is they make mistakes even if they accidentally censor just 1% of posts.\n\nThat's millions of people, and we've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech. So, we're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. More specifically, here's what we're going to do.\n\nFirst, we're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US. After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US. So, over the next couple of months, we're going to phase in a more comprehensive community notes system.\n\nSecond, we're going to simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse. What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it's gone too far. So, I want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms.\n\nThird, we're changing how we enforce our policies to reduce the mistakes that account for the vast majority of censorship on our platforms. We used to have filters that scanned for any policy violation. Now, we're going to focus those filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations, and for lower-severity violations, we're going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take action. The problem is that the filters make mistakes, and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn't. So, by dialing them back, we're going to dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms. We're also going to tune our content filters to require much higher confidence before taking down content. The reality is that this is a trade-off. It means we're going to catch less bad stuff, but we'll also reduce the number of innocent people's posts and accounts that we accidentally take down.\n\nFourth, we're bringing back civic content. For a while, the community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed, so we stopped recommending these posts, but it feels like we're in a new era now, and we're starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again. So we're going to start phasing this back into Facebook, Instagram, and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. Fifth, we're going to move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, and our US-based content review is going to be based in Texas. As we work to promote free expression, I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.\n\nFinally, we're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world. They're going after American companies and pushing to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world. Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws, institutionalizing censorship, and making it difficult to build anything innovative there. Latin American countries have secret courts that can order companies to quietly take things down. China has censored our apps from even working in the country. The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government, and that's why it's been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship.\n\nBy going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further. But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I'm excited to take it. It'll take time to get this right, and these are complex systems. They're never going to be perfect. There's also a lot of illegal stuff that we still need to work very hard to remove. But the bottom line is that after years of having our content moderation work focused primarily on removing content, it is time to focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our systems, and getting back to our roots about giving people voice. I'm looking forward to this next chapter. Stay good out there, and more to come soon.\n\n#### _Transcript of Joel Kaplan appearance on Fox and Friends, January 7, 2025._\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nAll right, buckle up. We got a Fox News alert moments ago. Meta the parent company of Facebook and Instagram announcing they are changing their policies to focus on free speech. CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying this.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg:**\n\nWe're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. More specifically, we're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nWow, this is a big deal. Changes include ending its third-party fact-checking program and lifting restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nWell, is there anything more important to talk about? Also, until now, meta used automated systems to scan for violations, but found they resulted in too much censorship. So from now on, they'll focus on tackling illegal and severe violations like terrorism fraud to name a few.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nAnd joining us right now to name one Fox and Friends exclusive, met as Chief Global Affairs Officer, Joel Kaplan joins us live here on the couch. Joel, welcome.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nThanks. Great to be here on the couch on Fox and Friends.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nIt's great to have you. You here? Okay, so you are announcing these big changes as of two minutes ago. If you're making big changes, does that mean you were doing something wrong before?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nLook, this is a great opportunity for us to reset the balance in favor of free expression. As Mark says in that video, what we're doing today is we're getting back to our roots in free expression. There's a number of changes we're making, but if I could, and just highlight three first is, as you heard, we're eliminating the third-party fact-checking system. Well-intentioned at the outset, but there's just been too much political bias in what they choose to fact-check and how, so we're just scrapping it entirely.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nYou say \"they,\" what do you mean? You mean \"you.\"\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nThe fact-checkers.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nYou set up your, but they're your fact-checkers, right?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nSo the idea was they're independent, but they've just been too biased. And so what we're going to do instead is adopt a system like X has of community notes. So we're just going to rely on our own community of users to provide people more information about what they're seeing and we think that's going to work great.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nSo give us an example. If we said, if the headline is Donald Trump won the presidency, then anyone in the community can write notes underneath it.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, great question. So somebody can write a note and then the way it works is different people on the platform can sort of vote on that note. And if you get people who usually disagree who all say, yeah, that sounds right, then that note gets put on the post and people see it. X has been doing it for a while, we think it's working really well, and we're going to adopt that system.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nAnd what are the other ones you want? I know you want to go through.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nThank you. So the second one is about the rules that govern content on our platform. They've just become too restrictive over time about what people can say, including about those kind of sensitive topics that you mentioned that people want to discuss and debate. Immigration, trans issues, gender. We want to make it so that bottom line, if you can say it on tv, you can say it on the floor of Congress. You certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship. So we're changing those rules. And then the last thing, if I could, we're also going to change how we enforce the rules and we're going to make it so that there's way less over-enforcement and way fewer mistakes that actually make up the vast majority of censorship that people experience on our platforms. So big changes all in service of getting us back to our values of free expression.\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nSo Joel, I guess the big question is where are the changes coming from? Because I mean, it's hard not to notice there's been a change in Mark Zuckerberg. You've seen him as respectfully the nerdy kid, change over to the jujitsu. He's put on some lean muscles. His viewpoints have changed, his posting content. When he does speak, he's meeting with Trump, taking a different stance on certain things. Are these changes coming from him or from what the public is saying?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, there's no question that the things that happen at Met are coming from Mark, but there's also no question that there has been a change over the last four years. We saw a lot of societal and political pressure all in the direction of more content moderation, more censorship, and we've got a real opportunity now. We've got a new administration and a new president coming in who are big defenders of free expression, and that makes a difference. One of the things we've experienced is that when you have a US president administration that's pushing for censorship, it just makes it open season for other governments around the world that don't even have the protections of the First Amendment to really put pressure on US companies. We're going to work with President Trump to push back on that kind of thing around the world.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nSo Joel, why now? I know you said it's a change, but did you feel restricted over the last four years and this is the first time you have, it's in your business interests to express this quest for freedom?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, there's no question that there's an opportunity here with a new president taking office, as I said, who really believes in free expression. And that's just going to give us the space to get back to those values that Mark has talked about for a long mark gave a big speech six years ago at Georgetown about free expression, about these values. Unfortunately, there's been a lot of political and societal pressure here and around the world that have pushed away from those values. We've got a real opportunity to reset, get back to them, and really provide a space for how.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nHow was the Biden administration putting pressure on you specifically? Where they calling where they didn't like a post? What did they say? Take it down.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah. So Mark talked about this in a letter he sent to the House judiciary committee a few months ago that sort of outlined the way in which we got a lot of pressure around Covid in particular to take down more content, even things like humor and satire about the pandemic and about vaccines. So we did experience that kind of pressure. The decisions we made ultimately were our own. But there's a real opportunity here with President Trump coming into office with his commitment to free expression for us to get back to those values and really provide space for people to have the kind of discourse and debate they want to have.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nWould you do what X did? And that is unleash independent journalists like Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger onto, forensically, go through what you guys, or actually repressing, shielding, shadow banning over the last few years. Wouldn't that be part of this cleansing process?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nSo we've had an opportunity to do a lot of that with the House Judiciary Committee and Chairman Jordan over the last few months and years. And he put out a really thorough report on the experience that we and other companies have had. Honestly, we're pretty focused on the future and the opportunity we have right now with the changes we're making today to really open up the space for debate and expression on our platform.\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nIs the idea to get out of politics. Totally. And focus on just the enterprise of the free market. People debating things, or is it for Mark Zuckerberg to become Elon Musk and be influential as well work with the next administration or a little bit of both? I don't know.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, Mark's always going to be Mark Zuckerberg, but I think there is a real opportunity to work with the new administration, both on free expression, but also on American leadership and technology and innovation. This is something we've seen President Trump is really focused on making sure that we maintain US competitiveness and leadership on technology, things like ai. Those are obviously super important to our company and our industry, and we'll look forward to working with the new administration to advance those goals.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nAnd Joel, when you talk about content moderation, I think a lot of people watching right now are going, well, it sounds better if they're not taking instructions from the federal government, the Joe Biden administration saying, Hey, this is wrong. Take that down. So people like the idea that they're going to have a say where you can add the community notes going forward, but ultimately, is this one of the things you are doing as a company to make sure that Meta and the other social media companies aren't regulated by Washington? The last thing you guys want.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah. I think when it comes to expression, especially in the United States, we got a long tradition of the First Amendment and we think that the right thing is for individual users to have the ability to decide themselves what to say. Look, there's bad stuff that people do online like they do in the real world, and we want to make sure we don't have that. So we're still going to be enforcing against terrorism and drug sales and child sexual exploitation things. Everybody agrees have no business being on our platform.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nWhat about bullying all the young little girls? I remember, mark, remember he was on the Hill and he had apo.... he was kind enough to turn around and apologize to the families, but all those families have lost their kids from bullying. I have a nine-year-old, I'm starting to get concerned because eventually when she's in high school or even after, she'll be faced with these situations. So what do you say to those families?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, well, I'm a parent of two teenagers.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nGosh, you're in it.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, I'm in it. So these are issues that I take really seriously and that a lot of my colleagues who are also parents at Meta and those who aren't parents take really seriously. We got to make sure teens are protected online. We launched a few months ago a product called Teen Accounts that really puts parents in the driver's seat and makes it so that they can see what their kids can see and do online, who can contact them. We put kids in sort of built in default settings, the most protective settings we have. And then if you're under 16, you can't change those settings on Instagram without your parents' permission. We think that's a really good innovation and something we're hopeful. It's an area where Congress can act.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nHow do we do that setting? How do the parents find that setting on the phone before they give it to their child?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, so we will send notifications basically to the parents to let them know that this opportunity exists and the kid can't sign up for Facebook, or excuse me, for Instagram without being put into a teen account. And then their parent gets a notice and says, Hey, your kid's trying to sign up and if you want to change any of the settings, you can do it here.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nSo Joel, what you got to do is reestablish trust. I mean, people remember the Zuckerbucks into those key areas in 2020 that were deciding what candidate was going to win what state. And one of the reasons you are trying to do that is number one, making this announcement here. The other thing is changing your board to let people know maybe by the people that you're hiring that you asked to join, that their agenda doesn't match maybe the 2020 agenda. What have you done?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, we made a big announcement yesterday. Put three new board members on, great board members including Dana White, the president and CEO of UFC, guy's a legend, an incredible businessman, incredible entrepreneur, marketing genius, super excited to have him. A couple other great board members with real deep business experience that we put on the board. So those are important voices. Mark has always been great about getting different perspectives so that we sort of cover the waterfront of ideas and perspectives that we want to make sure are getting fed into the process.\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nJoel, can you tell the audience and the world that this is not a temporary stance? And what I mean by that is this just because you got Donald Trump in there for four years, are you guys going to continue this after his presidency or is this just a temporary thing for the moment?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nThis is an opportunity for us to get back to the values that Mark founded the company on. This runs deep for Mark. It's a great opportunity to rebalance and to get back to free expression.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nWhen you say rebalance, historically the big tech companies and social media companies have leaned to the left that is this dragging it closer to the center. I mean with Dana White, obviously a Trump ally as part of the board. Is the company becoming more central rather than leaning to one side or the other?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nI think the way to look at it is we are a platform for all people and all ideas.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nI know, but some people don't feel that certain and haven't felt historically that certain social media companies were hospitable to their points of view.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nNo question. And that's what I meant by rebalance. We want to make sure that they understand that their views are welcome and that we're providing a space for them to come onto our platforms, engage, express themselves, engage in the important issues of the day or not in the important issues today, and just whatever it is they want to talk about and share. And so we need to make sure they feel welcome. We need to make sure we rebuild trust, and that's a big part of what we're doing today.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nSo also there's something else could be in front of the Supreme Court and that's future of TikTok China controlled. So you're an American company, you decide to make this announcement. How does this relate to what TikTok could possibly do?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nSo look, we like competition. We think it makes us better. I know there are concerns that Congress has expressed and that the President and Congress and the courts are working through With TikTok, we're going to stay focused on what we're doing and how we make our platform as open and welcoming a place as possible for all points of view.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nDo you think it should be banned?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWell, that's something I'm going to leave to the president and the courts in Congress. We're focused, again, we're focused on what we can do to make our platforms the best they can be.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nIf Elon Musk didn't buy X and expose what he exposed and put community notes like that, do you think we'd be in? What did he in buying this and doing what he did do for the introspection that Facebook is showing right now?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nI think Elon's played an incredibly important role in moving the debate and getting people refocused on free expression. And that's been really constructive and productive, and we're just glad that we've got the opportunity now to make these kind of changes and to get back to our roots in free expression.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nMaybe all social media companies can learn a lot from this, because y'all were the original, mark was one of the originals at least. And so y'all have had to see all the changes in what works and what doesn't work and what Americans really want. So thank you for your honesty. Thank you for doing this for children and all your customers.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nAustralia has banned social media up until you're 16 years old. How do you feel about that?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nWe think the right way to do it is to trust parents. That's what we're doing with the teen accounts that I mentioned. And obviously we've got to work with governments and follow the laws that they pass, but I think there's a better way, and that's to put parents in charge. They know what's best for their teens and their kids, and that's what we're trying to do.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nWhat's your biggest customer? What age group?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nOh, that's a good question. I mean, we've got 3.2 billion people using our services, so we really have people across all ages and we want to make sure we're serving them all and letting them express themselves in a way, especially with teens where they're still kept safe.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nDid you talk to David Sacks about this? Who's going to be coming in as the AI czar?\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nYeah, we've talked to David. We're really excited about that post. We think he's going to do great things. He really understands the industry. He really understands crypto and AI, and we can't wait to start working with him.\n\n**Steve Doocy:**\n\nWell, Joel, thank you very much for stopping by the couch and making a big announcement today.\n\n**Lawrence Jones:**\n\nHopefully you'll come back as well.\n\n**Joel Kaplan:**\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you all for having me.\n\n**Brian Kilmeade:**\n\nA fair and balanced social media world. There you go. Thank you so much.\n\n**Ainsley Earhardt:**\n\nThank you. Nice to meet you.\n\n## Authors\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/3tzzh18d/production/13e89d005fe677a1c18c1b8be04209d7849a7de8-748x748.jpg?fit=max&auto=format)\n\n[Justin Hendrix](https://www.techpolicy.press/author/justin-hendrix)\n\nJustin Hendrix is CEO and Editor of Tech Policy Press, a nonprofit media venture concerned with the intersection of technology and democracy.

As of December 2024, Meta's market capitalization stands at approximately $1.48 trillion, making it the [world's 7th most valuable company](https://companiesmarketcap.com/meta-platforms/marketcap/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). With a market capitalization surpassing $1 trillion as of 2024 and over [3 billion monthly active users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) across its platforms, Meta\u2019s influence is undeniably strong. But this success isn\u2019t just driven by its widespread social media reach or its ambitious Metaverse vision. Here's an inside look at Meta\u2019s financial growth journey and how the company is revolutionizing the digital economy.\n\n### The Early Expansions\n\nMeta's journey toward global tech dominance began with its public debut in 2012, raising $16 billion in an IPO that valued the company at $104 billion. By the end of that year, [Facebook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebook-reaches-1-billion-users/2012/10/04/5edfefb2-0e14-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_story.html) (before merging into Meta) had surpassed 1 billion users. In the following years, Facebook's growth was driven by strategic acquisitions, such as [Instagram](https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/) for $1 billion in 2012, strengthening its presence in photo-sharing, and [WhatsApp](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/10/06/facebook-closes-19-billion-whatsapp-deal/) for $19 billion in 2014, expanding its mobile messaging capabilities. These acquisitions set the stage for the rebranding of Facebook's virtual reality division as \"Facebook Reality Labs\" in 2016, reflecting a growing commitment to AR and VR technologies. As Zuckerberg began to focus on the long-term potential of the Metaverse, Meta committed to pouring over $10 billion into [Meta\u2019s Reality Labs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse) division, positioning it at the forefront of the next wave of internet innovation.\n\n### The Stock and Investor Surge\n\nDue to Meta\u2019s impressive long-term growth potential as a leading AI tech company, investors have been flocking to the strategically restructured company. [Analysts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/10/whats-behind-the-80-rise-in-meta-stock/) noted that Meta\u2019s combination of AI-powered advertising tools and its growth in immersive technologies make it a compelling investment, thus resulting in a [80% stock increase](https://investor.atmeta.com/home/default.aspx) in 2024. Additionally, Meta\u2019s commitment to enhancing its [AR/VR hardware](https://technologymagazine.com/articles/how-meta-is-dominating-the-ar-vr-market-amid-global-demand) and software has placed it at the forefront of the immersive technology industry. Looking ahead, Meta\u2019s stock is expected to average around [$697.66](https://coincodex.com/stock/META/price-prediction/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in 2025, which is a 19% increase compared to the company\u2019s stock price in 2024. Meta's strong financial performance and positive analyst forecasts have significantly enhanced investor confidence, positioning the company for continued success in the evolving digital landscape.\n\n### The Advertising Juggernaut\n\nDespite Meta\u2019s growing focus on the Metaverse, its advertising business remains the core of its revenue model. By utilizing their digital advertising platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp, Meta is able to provide advertisers hyper-targeted ads across diverse demographics, which is key to its success. Despite challenges from big competitors like [Google and Tiktok,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/10/whats-behind-the-80-rise-in-meta-stock/) Meta\u2019s advertising revenue exceeded [$130 billion](https://investor.atmeta.com/financials/) in 2024, solidifying its position as a leading player in the global digital advertising market. This advertising strength continues to be the primary driver of Meta's financial growth, even as it pushes into new frontiers like the Metaverse and immersive digital experiences. As long as Meta can continue to innovate and provide value to advertisers, its advertising business will remain a critical pillar of its overall strategy.\n\nMeta's journey offers valuable lessons for businesses in any industry, especially when it comes to staying ahead of digital trends and diversifying revenue streams. By strategically diversifying its revenue streams and heavily investing in emerging technologies, Meta has positioned itself at the forefront of the digital economy. The company's robust 2024 performance, with a [19% year-over-year revenue increase](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/14/ai-powers-metas-strong-q3-growth-profits-soar/), highlights its resilience despite significant investments in new sectors. Additionally, their confidence in the Metaverse fostered a strong investment source, serving as reminder for B2B companies to prioritize long-term growth initiatives.

The announcements included VR headsets, AR glasses and AI capabilities, all aimed at advancing how users interact with technology.\n\n## Orion: Prototype AR Glasses\n\n![APTOPIX Meta Connect Conference](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66f5c9bf113d5c525667b49b/APTOPIX-Meta-Connect-Conference/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\n\nMark Zuckerberg wears a pair of Orion AR glasses during the Meta Connect conference Wednesday, Sept. ... \\[+\\] 25, 2024, in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez)\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\n\nPerhaps the most exciting announcement was for a product with a release date that remains a mystery. In a noteworthy reveal, Zuckerberg presented a prototype of Meta's first augmented reality glasses, codenamed Orion. These AR glasses represent significant research and development efforts, with echoes of Google\u2019s scrapped Glass project from 2015.\n\nOrion works by overlaying virtual information over a user\u2019s view by using light diffraction to create holographic projections in their field of view. Zuckerberg stated that the display is different from anything else consumers have used, in the sense that it\u2019s not actually a screen. Instead, it\u2019s a different type of display technology that uses small projectors in the arms of the glasses, which emit light into nanoscale 3D structures etched into the lenses.\n\nWhile Meta has not announced a release date for Orion, the prototype demonstrates the company's ongoing investment in AR technology, with unique technology that has the potential to make it stand out from similar offerings from the likes of the Immersed Visor, and even Apple\u2019s much bulkier Vision Pro headset. These glasses could potentially change how users interact with digital information in everyday scenarios, from navigation to real-time translation and entertainment, and with a large play like Meta joining the fray, there could be an increased chance for higher rates of adoption for such technology further down the line.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\n\n[**Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23\") [By\\\\\nKevin Payne\\\\\n\\\\\nContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/ \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/\")\n\n[Graphic Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23)\n\n[**Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23\") [By\\\\\nCassidy Horton\\\\\n\\\\\nContributor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton \"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton\")\n\n[Graphic Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23)\n\n## Quest 3S: A More Affordable Mixed Reality Option\n\n![US-INTERNET-TECHNOLOGY-META](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66f5c8c20a72d10459bfe71c/US-INTERNET-TECHNOLOGY-META/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\n\nA Meta employee sets up a Quest 3S, a new entry-level model of Meta's mixed reality headset, for ... \\[+\\] demonstrations for content creators and journalists ahead of Meta Connect, Meta's annual event on its latest software and hardware innovations, in Menlo Park, California, on September 24, 2024.

Priced at $299, the Quest 3S aims to make mixed reality experiences accessible to a broader audience, and its RRP is a stark contrast to the $3,499 asking price of Apple's Vision Pro.\n\nWhile it may not include all the features of its higher-priced Quest 3 or Apple counterpart, the Quest 3S retains the core mixed reality capabilities of the Quest 3, allowing users to integrate virtual elements with their physical surroundings. The headset also features spatial audio by Dolby Atmos and can function as a remote desktop for Windows 11 PCs, leveraging Meta's partnership with Microsoft.\n\n## AI Developments\n\nMeta also used Connect as an opportunity to share its AI advancements, introducing various new features across its platforms. A significant announcement was Llama 3.2, Meta's latest AI model capable of processing both images and text \u2014 a first for the company's open-source offerings.\n\nThis multimodal approach expands possibilities for developers, potentially enabling more advanced AI applications. Examples include augmented reality apps with real-time video understanding, visual search engines and document analysis tools. In addition, Meta introduced voice capabilities for its AI assistant, including celebrity voice options such as John Cena, Dame Judi Dench and Kristen Bell.\n\nOther AI-powered features include real-time language translation through Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and automatic video dubbing for content on Instagram and Facebook. These tools could be particularly useful for content creators and marketers aiming to reach global audiences \u2014 although the [EU AI Act](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/09/19/how-the-eu-ai-act-stands-to-impact-business/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20member%20states,t%20be%20the%20first%20time. \"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/09/19/how-the-eu-ai-act-stands-to-impact-business/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20member%20states,t%20be%20the%20first%20time.\") means that these AI features won\u2019t be available to European users for the time being.\n\n## Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: New Features\n\n![Meta Connect Conference](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66f5c9e1a871f72d321714d0/Meta-Connect-Conference/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\n\nMark Zuckerberg speaks about the live translation feature on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses during ... \\[+\\] the Meta Connect conference Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez)\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\n\nMeta announced updates to its smart glasses line-up, developed in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The latest version includes improved AI integration, designed to facilitate more natural interactions with Meta's virtual assistant and enhance object recognition capabilities.\n\nNew features include video AI, real-time translation and expanded content partnerships with services like Spotify, Amazon Music and Audible. These additions clearly aim to strengthen the position of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in the wearable tech market.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nOverall, Meta's continued investment in mixed reality and AI technologies indicates the company's view of these areas as foundational to future computing platforms. By introducing more affordable hardware like the Quest 3S and developing prototypes like Orion, Meta is working toward a future where digital and physical realities are increasingly integrated.\n\nChallenges remain, including user adoption rates, privacy concerns and regulatory considerations. However, Meta's announcements at Connect 2024 demonstrate its commitment to shaping human-computer interaction, which is an area that founder Mark Zuckerberg is clearly betting big on.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/esatdedezade)\u00a0or\u00a0[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esat-dedezade-a9a71243/).\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0[website](https://esatd.net).\n\n[![Esat Dedezade](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/66d774987129931f84cb015d/400x0.jpg?cropX1=0&cropX2=320&cropY1=0&cropY2=320)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/ \"Photo of Esat Dedezade\")\n\n[Esat Dedezade](https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/\")\n\n[Following](https://account.forbes.com/following \"https://account.forbes.com/following\")\n\nEsat Dedezade is a freelance tech and lifestyle journalist with 14 years' experience.
