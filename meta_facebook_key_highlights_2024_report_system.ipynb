    "Welcome! Before we begin, let's set some context. This will help you better understand the underlying motivation and intent of the project. Hopefully, it will motivate and inspire you to improve your programming skills and upgrade your abilities. I've designed this notebook to help you at every step, so if you ever get stuck, spend some time reading each line and folllowing each step exactly as prescribed and you will definitely find a solution. I can't accurately articulate how that works, but it works.\n",

    "## Personal Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firstly, this section is subjective. Feel free to ignore it. Whether you choose to believe or disbelieve the contents of this section, in either situation, the outcome of this project is independent of your most likely, well-intentioned judgement.\n",

    "- I've been following Mark Zuckerberg since I was in school, which is approximately since 2009/2010. I don't know the exact year but it was around this time when I learnt about him through the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We share several similarities in terms of personality, attitude towards life, and most importantly Programming. I don't know him personally so this is based on his public appearances and whatever I have heard or read about him online and from people. Assuming that all the information I gathered is true, then if the world were devoid of biological and cultural nuances, and we were all judged purely as Programmers, it would be fair to say that I'm like Mark Zuckerberg's younger \"programming brother\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most importantly, he was and is still a \"hacker\" at heart. If you don't believe me, observe every public announcement Meta makes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have never officially worked at Meta but I like to consider myself as an invisible and unofficial contributor (not employee) at Meta. I came up with this idea to motivate myself to keep up to the standards of the ever evolving tech world and to maintain a cultural identity of myself which closely resembles \"The Hacker Culture\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- There's a lot to add, but as time progresses, I'll continue talking about \"Mark Zuckerberg's influence on AdiPat's life\" in greater detail!\n",
