    "## Step 1: Define YouTube Video URL Template\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves defining a reusable URL template for constructing YouTube video links. It lays the foundation for dynamically generating complete URLs for specific videos by substituting a placeholder with a unique video ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constant Variable:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `WATCH_URL` is a string intended to act as a template.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The use of uppercase naming (`WATCH_URL`) follows the convention for constants, indicating that the value should remain unchanged throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URL Template:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The URL represents the standard structure of a YouTube video link, with the `{video_id}` placeholder serving as a dynamic segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The fixed part of the URL is `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=`, which remains consistent for any YouTube video.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Placeholder:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `{video_id}` is a placeholder that can be replaced using Python's string formatting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This allows the program to dynamically generate complete video URLs for any given video ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- This template is especially useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Dynamically generating a full YouTube URL for a specific video by substituting the `{video_id}` placeholder with an actual video ID.\n"

    "## Step 2: Define Custom Exception Hierarchy for YouTube Transcript Retrieval Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a series of custom exception classes to handle various errors related to retrieving YouTube transcripts using a hypothetical API called `youtube-transcript-api`. The classes inherit from the base exception class `CouldNotRetrieveTranscript`, which is extended by more specific exceptions for different causes. Below is a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base Exception: `CouldNotRetrieveTranscript`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  This is the base exception class raised when a transcript for a YouTube video cannot be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes:**  \n",
    "  - `ERROR_MESSAGE`: A template message that includes the URL of the video for which the transcript couldn't be retrieved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `CAUSE_MESSAGE_INTRO`: A string template for introducing the cause of the error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `CAUSE_MESSAGE`: An empty string placeholder that will be populated in derived classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `GITHUB_REFERRAL`: A message that encourages users to report issues on GitHub if they believe the cause isn't described and gives guidance on how to report the issue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods:**  \n",
    "  - `__init__(self, video_id)`: The constructor accepts the video ID of the YouTube video for which the transcript couldn't be retrieved. It also calls the parent constructor to initialize the exception message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `_build_error_message(self)`: This private method builds the error message by formatting the base `ERROR_MESSAGE` and adding more detailed information about the cause if available. It also appends the GitHub referral message if a cause is provided.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `cause`: A property method that returns the `CAUSE_MESSAGE`. This can be overridden in subclasses to provide specific causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derived Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "These are subclasses of `CouldNotRetrieveTranscript`, each with its own specific cause for the failure to retrieve a transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `YouTubeRequestFailed`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  Raised when a request to YouTube fails due to an HTTP error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes:**  \n",
    "  - `reason`: Stores the HTTP error message as a string.  \n",
    "\n",

    "  \"The video is no longer available.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Cause:**  \n",
    "  The error message instructs the user to provide only the video ID and not the entire URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `TooManyRequests`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  Raised when YouTube receives too many requests from the same IP address and requires the user to solve a CAPTCHA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cause:**  \n",
    "  It provides suggestions for how to work around this, such as solving the CAPTCHA manually, using a different IP, or waiting for the ban to lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `TranscriptsDisabled`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  Raised when subtitles (transcripts) are disabled for the video by the uploader.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cause:**  \n",
    "  \"Subtitles are disabled for this video.\"\n",

    "### 9. `CookiePathInvalid`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",

    "- **Cause:**  \n",
    "  \"The provided cookie file was unable to be loaded.\"\n",

    "  \"The cookies provided are not valid (may have expired).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. `FailedToCreateConsentCookie`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  Raised when the system fails to automatically create a consent cookie (likely for handling cookies in requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cause:**  \n",
    "  \"Failed to automatically give consent to saving cookies.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. `NoTranscriptFound`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  Raised when no transcript is found for any of the requested language codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes:**  \n",
    "  - `_requested_language_codes`: The list of language codes the user requested.  \n",
    "  - `_transcript_data`: The transcript data (likely empty or partial).  \n",

    "This method returns a string representation of the available transcripts, including both the manually created and generated transcripts, as well as the translation languages available for the video.\n",

    "### 6. `Transcript`\n",
    "\n",
    "Represents an individual transcript for a video. It stores metadata such as the language, URL, and whether the transcript is automatically generated.\n",

    "#### Key Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **fetch**:\n",

    "Retrieves the actual transcript data by making an HTTP GET request to the transcript URL. It uses _TranscriptParser to parse the transcript data into a list of dictionaries containing text, start time, and duration for each segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **translate**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the transcript is translatable (i.e., it has available translation languages), this method allows the transcript to be translated into another language. It raises an exception if the transcript is not translatable or if the target language is unavailable.\n",

    "### 7. `_TranscriptParser`\n",
    "\n",
    "This class parses the transcript XML data into a usable format. It can either remove all HTML tags or preserve certain formatting tags (like strong, em, etc.), depending on the preserve_formatting flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_get_html_regex**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns the appropriate regular expression for removing or preserving HTML tags based on the preserve_formatting flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "If preserve_formatting is True, it allows certain tags like strong, em, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **parse**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method parses the XML data and returns a list of dictionaries, each containing the text, start time, and duration of each transcript segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The code raises several custom exceptions when certain conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **YouTubeRequestFailed**: Raised if an HTTP request fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **InvalidVideoId**: Raised if the video ID is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TranscriptsDisabled**: Raised if the video has transcripts disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoTranscriptAvailable**: Raised if no transcripts are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TooManyRequests**: Raised if the video has been blocked due to too many requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These exceptions help handle specific issues and ensure that errors are meaningful and easily traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is designed to fetch, manage, and parse YouTube video transcripts using both manually created and automatically generated captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It handles version compatibility between Python 2 and 3, provides methods to find and retrieve transcripts in different languages, and includes robust error handling for various failure scenarios (e.g., missing captions, consent issues, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "By abstracting the transcript-fetching process into several classes (TranscriptListFetcher, TranscriptList, Transcript, _TranscriptParser), the code is modular, making it easier to manage and extend.\n"

    "## Step 5: Transcript Formatter System\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a system for formatting transcripts into different formats, such as plain text, JSON, pretty-print, SRT (SubRip Subtitle), and WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `Formatter Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "This is an abstract base class for all formatters. Subclasses of Formatter must implement the `format_transcript()` and `format_transcripts()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "- **format_transcript()**: Should be implemented by subclasses to return a formatted string representation of a single transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **format_transcripts()**: Should be implemented by subclasses to return a formatted string representation of a list of transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `PrettyPrintFormatter Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formats a transcript using Python's `pprint` (pretty print) module for a readable output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **format_transcript()**: Converts a transcript into a pretty-printed string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **format_transcripts()**: Formats a list of transcripts by using the `format_transcript()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `JSONFormatter Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts transcripts into a JSON string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **format_transcript()**: Converts a single transcript into a JSON string using `json.dumps()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **format_transcripts()**: Converts a list of transcripts into a JSON string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `TextFormatter Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts transcripts into plain text with no timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **format_transcript()**: Returns a string where the transcript's text is joined with newline breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **format_transcripts()**: Converts a list of transcripts into plain text, with each transcript separated by a double newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `_TextBasedFormatter Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a base class for formatting text-based formats (like SRT or WebVTT) and extends `TextFormatter`. It defines helper methods that handle timestamps and the formatting of transcript lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_format_timestamp()**: Converts a time in seconds into a timestamp string format (this method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_format_transcript_header()**: Formats the transcript header (this method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_format_transcript_helper()**: Helper method that formats each transcript line (this method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_seconds_to_timestamp()**: Converts a floating-point number representing seconds into a formatted timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. `SRTFormatter Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formats a transcript into the SRT subtitle format, which includes a specific timestamp format and line numbering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "- **_format_timestamp()**: Converts a timestamp into SRT format (e.g., 00:00:06,930).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_format_transcript_header()**: Joins the transcript lines with newline breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_format_transcript_helper()**: Formats each transcript line in the format required by SRT, including line numbers and timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. `WebVTTFormatter Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formats a transcript into the WebVTT format, typically used for captions and subtitles on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_format_timestamp()**: Converts a timestamp into WebVTT format (e.g., 00:00:06.930).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_format_transcript_header()**: Adds the \"WEBVTT\" header and joins the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_format_transcript_helper()**: Formats each transcript line with timestamps in WebVTT format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. `FormatterLoader Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loads the appropriate formatter class based on the requested formatter type (e.g., JSON, pretty, text, WebVTT, SRT).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **load()**: Takes the formatter type as input and returns the corresponding formatter object. If the requested formatter type is invalid, it raises an `UnknownFormatterType` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. `Exception Handling`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UnknownFormatterType Exception:\n",
    "Raised if a non-supported formatter type is requested, providing a clear error message with the available options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. `Example Use Case`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to format a transcript into a WebVTT subtitle file, you would use `FormatterLoader` to load the `WebVTTFormatter` and then call `format_transcript()` to generate the formatted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "## Step 6: YouTube Transcript API Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **requests**: This module is used to make HTTP requests in Python. It simplifies working with web data, especially in handling responses, including headers, cookies, and payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cookiejar**: This is used to handle cookies in HTTP requests. Cookies are small pieces of data that a server stores on a client’s machine. In this code, it’s used to manage YouTube authentication cookies. The code first attempts to import `http.cookiejar` (common in Python 3), and if that fails, it falls back on `cookielib` (used in Python 2.x). This allows the code to be compatible with both versions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Class Definition: `YouTubeTranscriptApi`\n",
    "\n",
    "This class contains methods to fetch transcripts for YouTube videos. It handles multiple functionalities like retrieving transcripts, managing languages, and handling errors. The class methods are defined as class methods, which means they are bound to the class itself and not instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `list_transcripts` Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method retrieves a list of available transcripts for a specific YouTube video using its `video_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It starts by creating a session for HTTP requests. Sessions allow you to maintain persistent settings like cookies and headers across requests.\n",
    "- If the `cookies` parameter is provided, it loads the cookies from the specified file to authenticate requests.\n",
    "- If proxies are provided, they are used for routing the requests through specific network paths.\n",
    "- The method then calls a helper class `TranscriptListFetcher`, which uses the session to fetch available transcripts for the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `get_transcripts` Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows fetching transcripts for multiple videos at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It accepts a list of `video_ids`, a list of preferred languages (for transcript language preference), and other optional parameters like proxy settings and cookies.\n",
    "- The method iterates over each video in the list and tries to retrieve its transcript. If an error occurs for any video and `continue_after_error` is set to `True`, it skips that video and continues with the others. Otherwise, the error is raised, stopping the process.\n",
    "- It returns a dictionary mapping video IDs to their corresponding transcripts and a list of video IDs that couldn’t be fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `get_transcript` Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method retrieves the transcript for a single video.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It combines the `list_transcripts` method and a helper method (`find_transcript`) to get the transcript in the specified language(s).\n",
    "- After finding the desired transcript, it fetches the actual content and, if needed, can preserve HTML formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. `_load_cookies` Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is used to load cookies from a file, which may contain authorization data needed to access transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It attempts to load cookies using the `cookiejar.MozillaCookieJar` object, which is specifically designed to work with cookies in a format similar to those used by Firefox.\n",
    "- If the cookies can’t be loaded (e.g., due to an invalid path or file), it raises a custom exception to indicate that the cookies file is either missing or invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CookiesInvalid**: This exception is raised when the cookies loaded from the specified file are invalid or incomplete. It requires the `video_id` as a parameter for contextual error reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CookiePathInvalid**: This exception is raised if the path to the cookie file is incorrect or the file itself is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is designed to interact with YouTube’s transcript system, allowing the user to retrieve transcripts in different languages for YouTube videos. It handles multiple videos at once and manages cookies and proxies to enable the fetching of transcripts, especially for authorized content. The code also takes care of error handling, like invalid cookies or missing files, ensuring a smooth process for users to fetch and work with video transcripts.\n"

    "## Step 8: Integrate and Query Google Gemini API\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`import google.generativeai as genai`**: This imports the generativeai module from Google, which allows interaction with Google Gemini's generative models, enabling you to send queries to them and receive responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`import os`**: This imports the os module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as reading environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`from dotenv import load_dotenv`**: This imports the load_dotenv function from the dotenv module, which loads environment variables from a .env file into the Python environment. This is typically used to securely store sensitive data like API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Loading the Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`load_dotenv()`**: This function loads the environment variables from a .env file into the current Python session. It helps in managing configuration data like API keys, paths, and other sensitive information securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Setting API Key and Model Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`gemini_api_key = os.getenv(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\")`**: This retrieves the value of the GEMINI_API_KEY from the environment variables. The API key is required for authenticating requests to the Gemini API. If the key is not found, it will return None.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL = \"gemini-1.5-flash\"`**: This sets the default model to use with the Gemini API. In this case, it is set to \"gemini-1.5-flash\", which specifies a particular version or configuration of the Gemini model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Function to Get the Gemini Client\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`def get_gemini_client(model=DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL):`**: This defines a function `get_gemini_client` that takes an optional argument model (defaulting to `DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL`). This function is used to initialize and return a client that can interact with the specified Gemini model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`genai.configure(api_key=gemini_api_key)`**: This configures the genai module by passing the API key (`gemini_api_key`) so that the client can authenticate requests to the Gemini API.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **`model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name=model)`**: This initializes the `GenerativeModel` object from genai, using the provided model name (model). This object will be used to interact with the specified Gemini model for generating content.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **`return model`**: The function returns the initialized `GenerativeModel` client that is ready to generate content using the specified model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Function to Query Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`def gemini(query, model=DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL):`**: This defines a function `gemini` that takes two arguments: `query`, which is the prompt or query you want to send to the Gemini model, and `model`, which specifies the model to use (defaulting to `DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`model = get_gemini_client(model)`**: This calls the `get_gemini_client` function to get the Gemini client initialized with the specified model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`response = model.generate_content(query)`**: This sends the provided query to the Gemini model for content generation. The `generate_content` method is used to request content based on the query, and it returns a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`return response.text`**: The function returns the `text` attribute from the response, which contains the generated content from the Gemini model based on the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This script provides two main functions:\n",

    "## Step 9: Fetch and Convert YouTube Transcript to Markdown Format\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Imports**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **`from youtube_transcript_api.formatters import TextFormatter`**\n",
    "- This imports the `TextFormatter` class from the `youtube_transcript_api.formatters` module. The `TextFormatter` is used to format the transcript into plain text from the raw transcript data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi`**\n",
    "- This imports the `YouTubeTranscriptApi` class from the `youtube_transcript_api` module. It is used to fetch the transcripts for YouTube videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`from IPython.display import display, Markdown`**\n",
    "- This imports the `display` and `Markdown` functions from the `IPython.display` module. The `display` function is used to display objects (in this case, Markdown) in Jupyter notebooks or interactive Python sessions. `Markdown` is used to format text in Markdown syntax for rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Function to Convert Transcript to Markdown Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `def transcript_to_markdown(text_transcript: str) -> str:`\n",
    "- This defines a function `transcript_to_markdown`, which takes `text_transcript` (a plain text representation of a YouTube video transcript) as an input and returns the formatted transcript in Markdown format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Prompt Creation**\n",
    "- **`prompt = f\"\"\"...\"\"\"`**: This creates a formatted prompt string for an AI model (presumably Google Gemini, from previous code) to convert the plain text transcript into a properly formatted Markdown version. The prompt specifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Convert the given text transcript into Markdown format.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Include all information from the transcript without altering the facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Identify and tag speaker boundaries, assigning labels like 'Speaker 1', 'Speaker 2', etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Clean up and properly format the Markdown output.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It appends the `text_transcript` as the input for the AI model to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Response from Gemini Model**\n",
    "- **`response = gemini(query=prompt)`**: This sends the formatted prompt to the `gemini` function (which interacts with the Gemini model) and stores the response in the `response` variable. The model will process the transcript and return a properly formatted Markdown version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`return response`**: This returns the formatted transcript generated by the Gemini model. The response is in Markdown format, which can be displayed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formatter Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `formatter = TextFormatter()`\n",
    "- This creates an instance of the `TextFormatter` class. This formatter is used to convert the raw transcript (which is in JSON format) into plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Fetching and Formatting the Transcript**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `video_id = \"no_XaCE969Y\"`\n",
    "- This defines the `video_id` variable with a sample YouTube video ID (`no_XaCE969Y`). This ID will be used to fetch the transcript for this video.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)`\n",
    "- This calls the `get_transcript` method from the `YouTubeTranscriptApi` class to fetch the raw transcript data for the specified video ID. The transcript will be in JSON format, with each entry containing timestamps and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `text_transcript = formatter.format_transcript(transcript)`\n",
    "- This uses the `TextFormatter` instance to format the fetched transcript into plain text. The `format_transcript` method will convert the raw JSON transcript into a clean, human-readable text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Converting the Transcript to Markdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `transcript_markdown = transcript_to_markdown(text_transcript)`\n",
    "- This passes the formatted plain text transcript (`text_transcript`) to the `transcript_to_markdown` function, which generates the Markdown-formatted version of the transcript by calling the Gemini model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Displaying the Markdown Transcript**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `display_markdown = Markdown(transcript_markdown)`\n",
    "- This creates an instance of the `Markdown` class with the `transcript_markdown`. The `Markdown` class is used to format the content into Markdown so it can be rendered properly in environments that support Markdown (e.g., Jupyter notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `display(display_markdown)`\n",
    "- This uses the `display` function to render the `display_markdown` object in the output cell of a Jupyter notebook or IPython environment, showing the formatted transcript in Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code fetches a transcript from a YouTube video using `YouTubeTranscriptApi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It formats the raw transcript into plain text using `TextFormatter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The formatted transcript is then sent to the `gemini` function, which uses an AI model (likely Google Gemini) to convert it into a properly formatted Markdown transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the Markdown-formatted transcript is displayed using the IPython `display` function in a Jupyter notebook or similar environment.\n"
